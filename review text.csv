I typically get the Vegetable Yakisoba here. The seasoning is tasty to me and it's not overly oily. Also, their Mongolian Beef and Spicy Chicken dish is also pretty good. The meats are tender which a huge plus.

They have a soup stand for those dining in next to the register. You can also get yourself a glass of water/tea next to it which is convenient. 

Service is always friendly, but during busy times, you may have to wait awhile for food. Calling ahead is always a good idea during lunch hours."

ordered:
-hazelnut
-chocolate
-raspberry

207929,"They have a newly revised menu! Yay!

They now offer sweet potato fries!  I happily ordered these and found them delightfully crispy and delicious.  They also added homemade mac du jour and something called ""mac fries"", which I haven't tried.  It's cool they offer them though. 

They also added jalapenos, diced green chiles, and cream cheese as burger toppings in Build Your Own.  (I'm so excited to build a Southwest/Tex-Mex burger the next time I go with those green chiles!)

Other things I really like about this place that I haven't already mentioned: they have small shakes for under $5, which is still plenty for 1-2 people.  Also, the housemade vegetarian black bean patty is seriously delicious.  I'm always satisfied and stuffed with the delicious vegetarian burgers I build here.  

Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle!"
210834,Thank god they don't wrap any shrimp into wonton.  Broth is really yummy too!
898551,"I first came here with my dad and a friend of his after they attended a UW game, and I know it was the perfect choice - a good beer and burger were just what they needed. My next experience with The Ram was the restaurant in Tacoma, where my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for a beer after visiting the ZooLights at Point Defiance Zoo. This third visit to the Northgate location more than lived up to my expectations - good beer, and good burgers. Our service was a little slow, but we had a waitress-in-training, and she seemed very eager to do her job well, so I didn't take our longer-than-usual waits between being seated, ordering drinks, ordering entrees, and asking for dessert and our check as a bad sign, or as a sign that we were being ignored. In fact, I appreciated that she was upfront about her lack of experience, rather than making us wonder why this was taking longer than normal.

I love the atmosphere of sports bar, even though I could care less about sports myself, and The Ram is no different - TVs on every wall, lots of games going on, and people sporting jerseys (pardon the pun!) from whatever game had gone in in Seattle that day/evening.

If you're looking for a quick in-and-out experience, skip The Ram. If you want to take some time to linger over some excellent beer, go right on in. And if you can't decide between the six or seven home brews, get the sampler - you can't go wrong!"
987290,"Being from San Francisco, I have a very high expectation... Taqueria la fondita #2 is by far the absolute best of seattle!!!  I was very disappointed when I first moved here, I was told chipotle was as good as it gets!!!  Otherwise it's ""tex-mex""... Burritos served with tater tots. 
This taqueria rocks!  They're in a ghetto parking lot and they're kinda far but sooo worth it!  I've been there the last three days, I can get enough!  I finally found a perfect taqueria!!!  One complaint... Why don't taquerias in seattle serve chips and salsa?"
2581251,"Came here with my husband as we were spending the day on Whidbey Island for the Fourth of July. Bottom line, service was poor. Our server kept disappearing on us and I thought it was unprofessional of her to blame everything on the cooks and how they were backed up with orders, etc. Also, she was only tending like, 3-4 tables so there was no reason for my husband and I to be ignored. Just to bring us coffee, and to simply ask how we are doing seemed to be a struggle for her.

The food didn't make up for the lack of service either. I ordered their frittata special which was really runny and salty in the middle (gross.) The biscuits that it came with were decent but they were served plain and of course, our server didn't bother bringing or offering some sort of accompaniment to go with the biscuits.  However, my husband did enjoy his brioche French toast so that was nice.

No reason to go back to this place after this experience."
2144205,"Two words - the best. That is the best sandwich I have had. Fortunate for me I heard about this gem from the doorman at the Fairmont Olympic who indicated that he drives across time and waits in a long line-up for the food here.

I ordered the #8 on this day which is the Paseo press - wow! So simple with ingredients which all came together to make a very good lunch that day.

Well worth the drive and wait. When the food is this good you must take the perceived bad and hope it is your day to seize a sandwich."
2122333,I love it because I know when i am in Seattle I NEVER have to buy gum;)
1087329,"I came here with my parents for one thing only: Dungeness Crab! Their ""Crabby Hour"" from 3-5pm M-F in the bar lets you get a whole steamed crab for $25 which is a killer deal in Seattle. I will have to say that the ""Bar"" is literally three TINY ASS bar tables and maybe 4 bar stools at the bar. That is it, so if you come here for this, you better come right at 3, or come by yourself and maybe another person (bc honestly, who wants to eat by themselves..) 
Anyway, the Dungeness crab was delish, but how difficult is it really to steam a crab? Since it is a Tom Douglas restaurant, add an extra 10 bucks to the meal price and since it is steps away from Pike Place, add another 10 bucks. Because of the location, expect virtually no parking and lots of people (tourists) everywhere. But, if you are fortunate to have your stars align where you find both a parking spot, and a chair at the bar, then tie that bib on and go to town on a crab!"
666649,"Finally took some time and ventured into this little bakery the other day. I don't live very far and I've passed through Columbia City plenty of times but for some reason I rarely stop by local places.

It could be that I was nearly famished but the Rustica Torte was utterly delicious! It was hard to decide what I wanted to eat but the torte looked so yummy I just couldn't resist. I also got the strawberry rhubarb danish and a short macchiato. My complete brunch was filling and very satisfying.

Service is fine, up to par. The barista was a sweetheart. There are so many tempting treats I want to try. Gameover for my diet lol. Portion to price ratio is fair, completely worth it."
664397,"The entrees were good, but I think the dolmades lacked a fresh-made flavor (they tasted like canned ones you can get in a Mediterranean specialty store).  Service was friendly but not particularly fast, which is fine if you're not in a hurry (we weren't).  Overall, a nice find for Greek food in Seattle."
1666506,Their vegetarian pho is simply the best! Everyone is so friendly and it feels so nice and homey in there! I go there as often as I can.
829034,"this place is beautiful, the service is great, the food is delicious, the drinks are awesome.  love it."
772049,"Just cause it's called bbq chicken, doesn't mean they're another popeyes. haha.

I don't come here often, but it's another korean food stop on the ave aside from others.

I always get dukboki or topoki and soup or the pancake. 

This is literally the only place I know around the U that serves the pancakes itself instead of just having them as a side dish.

My favorite has always been dukboki. Spicy rice cake. There's also topoki, which is the rice cake, but also includes noodles and eggs. I would say eat this the same day you have it, or else the rice cake will harden.

The soups are always their best dish especially the seafood soup. Tofu, seafood and the spicyness of the soup is on point.

It's not all Korean food here, they also have wings, chicken strips and fries. 

Quick service, very nice and the place is very spacey. Good place for a mellow vibe."
1710280,"Maybe I'm biased because I have never tried German food before and this was my first time.

I got the schnitzel with potato salad. The portions are humongous. I didnt really enjoy the food. The potato salad tasted very vinegary not sure if that's how it's supposed to be. They forgot to bring me the rye bread . It's understandable since it got busy towards dinner time. I reminded the server and she brought me COLD BREAD... I could only take one bite. At least warm up the bread in a toaster who serves cold bread. The only thing that was edible was the schnitzel it tasted like katsu.

The servers are very friendly. Great customer service even though they forgt my bread. I probably won't be back again it was overpriced for the quality."
1447574,"After going on 3 dates with Palace so far, I have to say Tom Douglas is impressing this lady. And I'm not talking about the shiny large colorful mosaic cock, ahem, I mean rooster in the window...I'm not that shallow :)   You see, I have this infatuation with the mussels. The mussels at Palace are plentiful, plump, fresh, local, and evenly cooked. I was not a mussel girl before, but Tom...yeah you clever man, you have converted me. The trout and the pecan pie did me in as well.  I absolutely detest traveling into the downtown area but to satisfy these rare lusting moments I will navigate through traffic plagued by constant roadside construction, one way streets, and confusing 5 way intersections. As far as personality goes, Palace has a sophisticated vibe that is unpretentious and manages to deliver unique and flavorful dishes with attentive service. Unfortunately, like any relationship, Palace has some flaws.  Although a wide variety of spirits are served, some of the cocktails taste flat. Sorry Tom, I have tasted better versions of the Moscow Mule. While I have ordered other dishes from the revolving seasonal menu and regular menu, my loyalty continues solely for the mussels and trout.  Looking forward to my next late night rendezvous. On weekends, I recommend making a reservation or you will wait a an hour or two. To be continued.."
226893,"I wandered in to watch the UW-Wazzu game during lunch today.  As it was late, and all the real fans were in the Arena, I snagged a table near the bright, big screen, and camped out for the whole game.

The waitress was fine, UW won the game, and the pulled pork sandwich was luscious.  The apple pie a la mode was also flawless.  Not too noisy.  Very nice.

Although I shouldn't blame the 50 North, the two 50-something guys drinking at midday at the bar, asking the waitress where she lived etc.,  and cheering for Wazzu I could have done without.

More seriously, I wasn't sure which was the legitimate parking, and the aura was somewhat generic, not quite 5-star territory, like Big Country over on University Ave., although more upscale.

A good place for a sandwich and a basketball game or a conversation."
1001498,"Rude customer service, terrible onigiri. I think they should be an order and pick up place instead of a sit down and order place. They don't know what they are doing in terms of seating and serving in a timely manner. I don't expect a high quality experience from a cash only restaurant, but I at least thought they'd be polite. I had to ask for tea three times and was basically ignored after receiving my food. And honestly, the udon is soggy (tastes like instant), and sushi has too much rice with a lack of seasoning. Service and food overall-  Awful, seriously."
1521666,"Fantastic ambiance! Ducking in of the busy streets, you'll feel like you've been transported to a European coffee shop! Cozy ambiance and sweet staff! I wanted to out the sweet ole Italian man (who I assume was the owner) in my pocket and take him home! He was adorable! The coffee was DELICIOUS! They offer alternative milks (soy AND almond!) and the coffee flavor is perfect! We shared a molasses cookie that tasted homemade and was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

LOVE this little hidden gem!!!"
180638,"Seems as if they changed chefs and the menu is different along with the quality.

Truffle fries are now ""meh"" and the portions are smaller than usual.

Please fix this...I used to rave about this place."
796998,"Went to Chaco Canyon today because it was close by, not necessarily because it was organic.  Overall, really good! I was just looking to do some work so ordered a muffin and a cup of coffee. The staff were super friendly and seemed like they enjoyed working there. The blueberry muffin was great and the coffee was good. Good atmosphere, not sure if it's the best place to study (a little noisy), but I'd definitely go again to do some lighter work on the computer. Wifi seemed to work well too."
1105619,"Love it! Especially on a very cold and rainy night. I ordered the SautÃ©ed garlic (sliced) rib-eye steak and really enjoyed my meal! I usually save half to eat for lunch, but I ate the entire dish! Noodles were fresh and I really enjoyed how the meat tasted fresh. That's a plus! My classmate didn't know what to expect, since it was her first time eating Vietnamese food. I enjoyed the place a lot that I'll be coming here again tonight. I'm a fan!"
1831893,"My boyfriend and I really like this restaurant. Though it's small, it's a great place to grab dinner and enjoy fresh sushi. Also, they are very accommodating to my vegetarian needs, which is a HUGE plus, as there aren't very many Japanese restaurants with good vegetarian options. 

We would highly recommend the Lion King roll, chicken teriyaki, and the dinner bento special. Roll, Roll, Roll is definitely my go-to sushi place."
774209,"So disappointing. My colleague and I went here for lunch today. Expensive but we wanted a nice lunch. There were just a few tables with customers and we waited for water or to give our order. We had to ask a bus person and waive down the hostess to get water and ask if we could order. A waiter came by and we finally ordered. I ordered a steak that the menu said would come medium. I tried to cut my steak, but could not. Asked for a steak knife to see if that would help. Found out the steak was rare. We only had an hour for lunch so I waved down a waitress and asked her to please just get me a hamburger (thinking this would be fast). It did take a bit, but the burger was really good. We did not see the original waiter but when the waitress came back with the check, she said she took off 10% because the burger was less than the steak I ordered. I couldn't believe it. They gave us poor service, did not deliver per the menu and still charged me. Even though I agree with their food philosophy and approach, I will not go back. Way too many restaurants in Seattle that have good food and excellent service."
1445209,"Why did I wait so long to come here? This little hole-in-the-wall restaurant that I didn't give a second look at for the longest time, all of a sudden has become one of my top places to dine in the I.D.

I came here for lunch with three friends on a Saturday, not expecting anything much. Boy was I surprised when I looked at the menu! Plenty of delicious looking dishes (with pictures) on there, a selection probably only bested by HK Bistro up the street. The place was nice and clean, with ample seating for our group around 1pm; hopefully it was a slow day for them.

I ordered a noodle dish with porkchop and an overeasy egg on top, situated on a hot sizzling skillet. Delicious! Not too salty with plenty of flavor. Service was good - the waitress was pretty attentive to us, refilling water and inquiring if we needed anything. 

Overall it was a great experience. AH...! Also, I remember why I never came here before. I think Joe's Bar next door had something to do with it. ;)"
2127035,"Delicious food, great atmosphere! Gorgeous place in Post Alley, romantic, great good, beautifully decorated, great service. We try cheese boards at almost every restaurant we visit and this is by far our favorite. Prosecco with your cheese plate is a winner. Lasagna is absolutely delicious and you can never go wrong with their special pasta dish (if it includes spinach fettuccine, don't hesitate to try).They generally also have great local musicians playing. In the summer, their open patio is a jewel. Lasagna is fantastic and on the desert menu the Panna Cotta is very light and tasty, worth trying for sure. If you happen to be here at the right season, they may even have a lavender Panna Cotta which is superb. Their wait staff is also very knowledgeable and helpful and make your dining experience even greater.....A must try in the Seattle restaurant scene. You will not be disappointed!!!"
1909902,"We were here over the summer, and thought it was impressive.  I am not a big fan of seafood, but our waitress convinced me to try the Blackened Halibut.  I am so glad she did.  If we come back to Seattle, we will be sure to make another reservation."
1335478,"I love the bar at Milagros, the bartenders are all super nice & though service can be a little slow, I always have a good experience. 
The drinks are reeeally expensive so I really only go there during happy hours, I will spend the money to get a few overpriced specialty cocktails because the bar manager, I'm not sure if this is his title but it should be, Drew, is INCREDIBLE. He makes some of the best drinks I've ever had. I would recommend stopping in and having a little chat with him about his drinks & he'll make you some of the best tequila cocktails you've ever had. Ask for a pomegranate margarita, he made it for me once when we got into discussing margaritas, and I was blown away.
Their salsa trio is pretty good, their guac usually requires a little lime and salt doctoring but it's decent, though I do believe a Cantina should have perfect guacamole, when it hits the table.
I've had the burrito and added the sauce they offer that is not mole, I can't remember what it was called. But the burrito was pretty good, I would order it again.
The quesadilla is a MUST TRY, in my opinion. The crema, whatever it is, they put on top is literally crack. I always get an extra side. 
I've also ordered their Al Pastor pork tacos, which sounded right up my alley, but I was  so underwhelmed. It was a very disappointing moment in my life, and after talking to the bartender he told me none of the tacos are too incredible. 
Which is ludicrous to me, because that must be some of their best selling items. 
I think Milagros is the kind of place where I urge you to go drink & enjoy an entree when drunken hunger arises, or munch on some happy hour food, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a good spot to go exclusively for dinner."
178035,"House of Hong sits right in the middle of everything: between the highway and I-district, between five star and spit in your food service and between the celestial awe of delicious dim sum, and dirt in your dumplings. They truly earn their 3 stars. 

On a Sunday morning they must make their business from all the hungry people unwilling to wait in line for Jade Garden or Harbor City, because that's why I came. The space is large, like Chinese banquet large, and the service fast as lightning! Within 5 minutes of sitting down we had tea ordered, and was swarmed by 3 carts. Unfortunately after we entered a calming period of eating, our requests (mustard, more water, the cheque) were not addressed as quickly. 

The dim sum straddled the line of ok and ok. I never knew that I could write about mediocre like this. 

The following dishes were average: 
- siu mai
- ha gow
- bbq pork bun
- turnip cake

And the following were off-putting: 
- chung fen (rice noodle roll)
- sugar cane shrimp

They also charged $6.75 for black pepper beef short ribs that were dim sum portions, and unfortunately we realized this only when the dish was finished. There was also a mistake in calculating our bill (cheaper items entered as more expensive). I'm not sure if it's common practice, so I would recommend to re-check your final bill.  

Tea also costs extra, which is more an annoyance than deterrent. 

Come here if you need dim sum fast like you need a boost to the heart, otherwise I take your money elsewhere."
2525748,"Service here is absolutely terrible. The food is good and the charbroiled rice noodle dishes are a nice alternative to teriyaki, so I go here occasionally. That said, I never walk in the Broadway Pho Cycle without feeling like I'm an inconvenience to the staff. I've just settled on taking it to go."
940261,The spicy basil fried rice is delicious! Not the best in town but not bad either. Good food for the price.
1825357,"My family went there tonight.......service is good but the portion is very surprised. I ordered the fish & chips, the 2 tiny fishes is good enough for kid but no adult. The price is $16.99....very pricey for me! 

I don't think I will go back for dinner, maybe will try their lunch in some days!"
816802,"Brings back childhood memories every-time I go. Salmon chowder, get that if you don't get anything else. Honestly, everything else is just average or good drunken munchy food."
956085,"My chicken penne gorgonzola was good, nice selection of local beer, price is acceptable, bar tender was pretty good. I'll go back"
2145111,"Been here before for brunch and loved it! Couldn't get in for happy hour this time and the host was less than cooperative. Open tables at 4:15 and we can't enjoy paying you for food for forty-five minutes? Oh, I'm sorry, can't even do that. You were fully reserved at five (really?). 

I run a successful restaurant and if we have open tables and people wanting to sit, we get their butts in the chairs. ""I can sit you but we need the table by 5, ok?"" That would have worked for us, but the gatekeeper at the front door didn't care. 

Let's do the math. 2 guests spending a total of $60 turned away once a day x 365 = $21,900. Why are you turning that away? You must be doing REALLY good to not worry about that. Nice job!

Rules are meant to be broken for the sake of the guest. When you forget that, you begin the downward slide into the failing restaurant zone.

I like you, Toulouse. Don't go down that road!"
990281,Awesome Sushi!!
1952869,Pssst!  You're wildest dreams have now come true.  There is a NEW Musashi's open in Factoria and it has no lines and PARKING!
2122062,"I was worried that in the year since I have been Lola that maybe I had lifted the doughnuts or the the breakfast to a pedestal that it did not belong.

I was dead wrong. Lola continues to defy my expectations. Doughnuts were amazing, sausage was savory and perfect. Service is impeccable, despite the geeky rabble I tend to walk in the door with."
837962,"Food wasn't bad. They have a pretty great lunch menu, and their hot sauce is pretty tasty!"
1776562,"We just moved into a new apartment down the street, so we figured we'd try Citizen for coffee the morning after our move-in day.

DAMN. Delicious food, great coffee, a fun atmosphere, and decent prices! Great service. 

Will likely end up as our new neighborhood breakfast joint.

Loved the movie theater seats upstairs! So fun!!"
777989,"Dropped in for brunch before an afternoon at the EMP.  Place was smoking busy, always a good sign.  You can wait for a table or grab the open spots at the bar, which is what we chose to do.

The menu claims to have the best tofu scramble in the world and they're not lying!  Spices were fantastic, so much veg and the tofu was cooked well.  Big portions too.

Seriously stiff drinks thank to the amazing free pour.  Oh and a fun jukebox that had a whole mix of different and awesome songs."
1837979,"Kate's is wonderful. By the third time I ordered the same omelet they almost start making it when I walk in. The staff treats each other like family, and include us. It's a classic restaurant, with Greek overtones, although Kate is Irish! Her Greek omelette and scrambles are the best! Not only do I go on my own, I bring my family, friends and people from work. 

Oh, and don' t forget to check out the best homemade hot sauce ever made, but don't use too much, unless you're me, lol!"
823725,"I love this place.  I look forward to getting my oil changed nearby because I get to come here for lunch while I wait.  The menu is gut bomb and delicious.  I haven't had anything I haven't really liked. I recommend the meatloaf sandwich, and always let Tim have his way with you.  That man knows a good sandwich.  They serve beer and pastries and coffee.  I like the laid back vibe and decor.  This place is a joint, not some overly designed and overly processed spot.  And the owners are top drawer!  They almost always give us complimentary samples of their specials.  And the last time I was in, I waited for my order at my car because it was hot and I didn't want to leave my dog out there.  The owner came out to chat and bring my pup some bacon while we waited.  How great is that?  Imagine that happening anywhere on Capitol Hill or Queen Anne."
1923034,"Great happy hour starting at 3:00.  We got there at 3:00 on the dot and recommend you show up early.  The space is limited for the bar, so shortly after we got seated the waiting area filled up quickly.  

We tried the chef's choice oysters which were served on a big tray of ice and were delicious!  Also tried a bunch of stuff on the happy hour menu--the best thing we had was actually the lime tequila mussels.  I'm not the biggest fan of mussels--until now.  These were the best mussels I've ever had.  Very flavorful and tender!  

The oyster stew was very bland.  I'd avoid that.  Just tasted like someone heated heavy cream, added Tabasco and then threw in an oyster or two.  The sliders were delicious!  The fried calamari was okay.  Nothing too exciting there.  

Great deal for oysters!"
2195516,"These guys really know what they are doing, could I say they are flavourologist? Some of the most delicious crepes around and if you are hankering for a milkshake...theirs will knock you on your ass with insane yumminess! Can't wait to go back!"
1332488,"One of my favorite Indian lunch buffets on the eastside.

They've recently renovated their interiors, and the place looks quite a bit nicer than it did a few months ago. The buffet-time service is still top-notch, with frequent water top-off, naan refills, and expended plate takeaways.

The food selection at the buffet is really a standout compared to some of the other buffets in the area. Some of the dishes are actually pretty flavorful--their chicken tikka masala, prepared with what appear to be diced jalapeno peppers and a darker, spiced sauce, is a wonderful departure from the bland, fluorescent orange cream of chicken preparation that most restaurants serve in their buffets. The curries and saag similarly have some spices in them, though the levels are still tame enough to maintain edibility for most.

The buffet also includes a dessert selection. It's nothing special--a simple mango custard and kheer being the primary offerings--but it's still very nice than it's included.

The biggest issue that Taj Palace still has is that its location gets *absolutely packed* during lunch. Either plan to arrive early or expect to park well down the street and wait in a bit of a line to get in."
1043305,"I saw my fellow Yelper, Cynthia, had checked into this place only a few hours earlier and the thought of Hot Pot on such a decidedly dreary day sounded great. Plus the free parking was a huge selling point. I mean, come on, where else can you park in the ID for free?
I was excited to try it out since she said you got to pick and choose your ingredients and quantity as opposed to other hot pot places where I've only been able to choose between Combo A, B or C with such and such choices available and no substitutions. What if I didn't want a pound of sliced beef? What if I just need a little to finish off my udon? Well here at Uway you can do it that way.
First off, parking: 1) yes it's Free!! Love it, love it, love it! 2) slightly shady since it was dim and was practically empty at about 4 in the afternoon on a weekday but it should go without saying never to leave anything of importance in your car, and 3) lots of construction on Jackson street confused us on where the entrance was so you might have to circle back to it once or twice like us in order to enter the garage but for free parking I'll gladly make like an eagle and circle a few times.
Second, the food: So it's real easy, after perusing the menu my hubby and I went with the Bone soup option for our Hot Pot which is not spicy at all because we were sharing with our 13 month old daughter. She loved it and I seriously hope she'll acclimate to spicier stuff as she gets older cuz her Mama LOVES the heat! Maybe next time I'd do a half and half hot pot but for our first time I like to stick with super basic stuff to get a good base-line on a place. You get your meats and veggies in the cooler and fill a bowl. I think it was $8.75/ pound so you grab as much as you want and if need be you can even go back for seconds because they tally up the weight for you and pay at the end of the meal instead of each time you go up. The meats looked clean and bright. They had lamb, pork, beef, cod, shrimp, mussels, squid, tripe, meatballs, fishballs, crab (not sure if its imitation or what) and sliced pig ears to name a few. The veggies were good too, no brown cabbage here, and a good amount of mushroom choices but I would have preferred more green choices like maybe zucchini slices, snow peas or even some carrots and baby corn. If you're like me you geek out over Enoki and my god I loved filling my bowl up with that stuff but yes, more veggie choices wouldn't hurt. I did enjoy the tofu choices but I couldn't tell you the names of them as I couldn't recognize some things. I got what I thought was water chestnuts and it ended up being something more like some sort of glutinous rice slice (?). I also grabbed some ramen noodles to toss in. My hubby went with bean three noodles (I think, again I can only guess). Next time I'm hoping to try the house made noodles that they apparently make for you in sight.
Overall it was a good experience. I wish more people were there so I could get a good feel for the crowd vibe but maybe next time. I'll be back."
1889891,Great convenient place in Redmond for some decent dum sum! The owner and staffs are really friendly. They look like they are family run.
829899,"I've been going to Avanti's for many years, they've always been a contender in the hotly debated ""best pizza in Lynnwood""category. We ordered a sausage and mushrooms the other day, picked it up (we're across the street) and as usual, just a great pizza! the sausage is quality stuff, no rubbery things in it, just melts in your mouth, and the mushrooms seemed fresh, not out of a can, (but thats doubtful) anyways they seem to be upping the ante lately with their dining room conversion, and the food getting better, and I'm totally in love with Janetta, so pretty, and just as sweet as can be. In Lynnwood, we have several choices for a good pizza, and we do try others, but Avanti's is always at the top of the list."
969991,"Went here for a quick lunch, worked well as they had very quick service. Tried the pollo a la diabla, which claimed to be spicy, and it had a bit of a kick. Nothing to write home about, but if you're in a hurry, these guys can have you in and out rather quickly."
1060510,"I love Gustav's.  I have been going to this location since they opened and they keep getting better.  More recent menu updates that include smaller portions and items to share, are perfect for me.  The happy hour menu is served in the main dining room, so if you have underage folks in your party, you can still get the deals.  It's great when you have late activities and need a place to eat after 9:00.  

It helps if you like German food, but there is really something for everyone.  The service is consistently good and they go out of their way to help you.

The only downside for us is that the main dining room gets very noisy during busy times.  If that's an issue for you, ask to be seated in a quieter part of the restaurant.  Not always possible, but that's my only complaint with this location."
903277,"A great place to start off your Friday night.  Pizza good,  beer good, service awesome!"
861474,"Man this place have good food! the poached egg with red wine fois gras sauce on brioche! the fries! the drinks! very nice cozy place, very attentive service!"
1037833,"Tried the triple threat, it was good. Switched between pineapple sauce and the walnut sauce, they were both yum. The only thing the was a bummer...NO KIDS MEAL. My son is 7 and i had to get him a burger that was as big as his head almost. He ate half. The burger was good though."
270558,"Very good pho, spicy broth was an interesting choice, decent serving size, friendly service.  I like it a lot, I just don't love it.  Solid 4 stars."

First day of work lunch! Winning! Okay, well this review is going to sound kind of conflicted. I consider myself a healthy eater and someone willing to spend the money on good food. However, rather than a Zagat rated restaurants, most of my money goes towards the Whole Foods Hot Food Bar. So keep this in mind when evaluating my view of RN74.

Setting: This restaurant is absolutely wonderfully designed. I loved every design aspect from the wine list on the wall that changes like the train schedule to the brick and the lighting. 

Service: The service was ahhhmazing. Literally the second my water glass was empty someone would literally, in almost a ghostly way as to make him/herself invisible, float by to refill it. I felt waited on hand and foot. Each server was absolutely polite and just WOW. No problems on the service. 

Menu: Here is where my first gripe is. Vegetarian. Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat...that was what filled the menu.Oh wait...I just checked out the menu again and there was a veggie burger. But still meat to veggie ratio is like 5:1. If I did ever end up returning, I would try one of their non-alcoholic drinks which sounded good and most had homemade syrup. 

Food: I ended up ordering the spring beet salad. Excuse my lack of food knowledge, but I didn't know what buratta was. We actually took bets at the table because I seriously thought it was meat. Apparently it is cheese! It was okay. I actually like feta or goat cheese better. The salad was presented beautifully, of course with salad dressing drizzle. I mean I can't negate that it was a very interesting salad. Never before have I tasted beet meringue! It was actually delicious, and I really did like the fresh assortment of beets. The pickled strawberry was also good. So if you put this analysis together, it would seem that besides the cheese, I liked the beet salad.

Price: Glad I wasn't paying lol. Most of the dishes are a bit pricier, but the lunch prices aren't too bad. They mark up the same items for dinner and at that point the prices become almost exorbitant. For example, beet salad at lunch $15. Okay....the salad wasn't that large so that's pushing it a tiny bit, but it was composed of high quality ingredients. Beet salad for dinner: 17.50 Say what!!! That is just your appetizer (except for me who eats lunch and dinner salads lol). 

Anyway, the food is creatively put together, tasty, and elegantly presented. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and service. I wish there were more vegetarian options."
868574,"Pretty delicious! The salsa was on par with most of the Mexican food places in the area. I didn't happen to try the pico de gallo, but I appreciated that they served it with the chips and salsa. I ordered the nachos with picadillo and they were easily some of the best nachos I've ever had. Lots of gooey cheese, picadillo, jalapenos, beans. So yum. My husband had the pollo a la crema, which he loved and said it was the best he'd had. Our friend had one of the combos and liked it as well.

The restaurant was nearly empty, with the exception of a very large family having lunch. Not sure if this is normal for a Sunday afternoon, since it was also Superbowl Sunday, but it was kind of nice. Only real downer about the place is the location. Slightly out of the way strip mall next to a storage facility with lots of closed businesses. Kind of weird. Didn't seem like there would be enough parking if the other stores in the strip mall were rented out. 

Delicious though! I'm a little sad I never made it in when I actually lived nearby, probably would've gone all the time."
2542613,"We moved from Portland and were missing Pine State Biscuits which we would go to once every two months..  We just had Serious Biscuit this morning and in all honesty this is so much better!
The biscuits are delicious but love the flavor profiles that are so interesting such as the sausage with the red pepper, the sweet and sour collard greens, and the creamy but airy grits.

So yummy, we're so impressed!"
2140041,"I had a GABA bowl with sprouted brown rice and the textures and flavors were excellent. The rice had a pleasant nuttiness and firm texture that was pleasing against the sunomo and fish slices. There was just enough of a sweet, soy sauce based sauce to accent the flavors without overwhelming them.  It was the perfect lunch portion; I didn't leave in a lunch coma. The price was good, too. This is going on my go-to list."
251130,"What the duck? How have I gone my whole life without a homemade black bean burger and tots from Zippy's? Seriously good stuff going on here. My friend had his usual meaty and cheesy burger and interestingly enough, commented mostly on the deliciousness of the bun. His son also had a cheeseburger but seemed to like the old school video games more. It's a little bit of a hole in the wall but aren't those always the best places? They also serve beer and they make their own root beer! It's old timey while still being hip and relevant. Don't be intimidated by the long lines, they go quickly. Definitely have someone in your group score a table while you wait to order though. Don't forget to grab the special sauce out of the fridge!"
1754291,"Awesome Vietnamese food!! I am visiting Bellevue from Vancouver and craved Pho. Used Yelp and discovered this place. I had the dinner combo #1 which you choose your pho, appetizer and tea. I choose small pho with rare beef, tripe and meat balls, fried spring roll and thai iced tea. 50% off for thai iced tea. What did I think? I rarely finish my meal but this time I cleaned it up well!"
1113208,"That was disgusting!  We ate there for lunch.  When we first arrived we were seated near a table of women and children.  The children were running around and around the table and restaurant, screaming and chasing each other, while the mothers chatted and ignored their brats (excuse me, little darlings).  Nice start - not!  We should have left.  For appetizers, we had the coconut shrimp and fried polenta.  The shrimp were tasty, but greasy, and there were only three shrimps for $5.  The polenta was also tasty but for almost $5 there were only 5 sticks.  We each had a pint of  Guinness.  She didn't tell us it was from a can, and when we asked her about it being canned, she said they don't usually bring the can out.  That seems deceptive - and it was only so, so.  I wanted to have a salmon burger, but when I saw that it was made of ground salmon, I changed my mind.  I had the pit roasted salmon that was way too fishy smelling and tasting - not fresh.  I sent it back and they made it for me again, but it wasn't any better the second time.  It had a creamy sauce with capers, but the capers tasted burnt.  The green beans and mashed potatoes were nice, but I still can't get the taste of that fish out of my mouth.  My husband had the salmon tacos (that salmon tasted fresher) but the thicker portions of fish were raw.  He was still hungry after he ate his tacos, so he ate most of the potatoes and green beans from my plate.

Bottom line, for it's name, the menu seemed to serve more Mexican style food and the quality of the salmon that was on the menu was sub-par and way too expensive.  We were really disappointed with Coho Cafe and won't go back."
974887,"I think Brasserie Four has become my favorite fancy restaurant in Walla Walla. They do a good job of making french cuisine for the Walla Walla audience - most of the time, the menu doesn't feature anything too fancy or unrecognizable. I recommend the cheese plate for an appetizer (it's constantly changing and featuring new cheeses!), the boeuf bourguignon, and one entree that's some creamy chicken dish that I can't remember the name of. The house wine is also pretty good, and cheaper than the other wines on the menu."
1183591,"Fonda La Catrina has been one of my favorite Mexican restaurants since it opened. Great food and drinks at good prices and a fun atmosphere. 

Last night I enjoyed another great meal with a friend and we were sitting at our table chatting after we had finished our food and paid the bill. I noticed people at another table pointing to something on the ground near our table and when I looked down I noticed there was a mouse right under our table. I immediately picked my feet up off be ground and raised a bit of a commotion in my shock. Next thing I know, a member of the restaurant staff came over and killed the mouse right under our table by hitting it with a large bussing tub. 

Another member of the staff then came over and said ""sometimes weird things happen!"" and left it at that. I understand that sometimes mice in restaurants is unavoidable, but her response to the situation was definitely avoidable. I was surprised and disappointed by her lack of apology or attempt to make the situation better. I'm disappointed that I won't be able to go back to this place!"
934398,"Yes a whole in the wall but who cares if they have the BEST salmon fish and chips on my whole trip.   Highly recommend this stop!  Besides since when do we listen to everything? Well do listen to me on this one! I promise they will not disappoint.

Disclaimer:  make sure you get the salmon fish and chips as I can't vouch for anything else."
1371241,"You will find the usual fare at this strip mall Chinese restaurant. However, our dishes were surprisingly lacking in flavor.

We ordered the sweet and sour and the Szechwan chicken. Both served with soup, fried rice, and a spring roll.

The soup had little flavor and was gelatinous from all the corn starch. The fried rice was the most disappointing. Just white rice doused with soy sauce. The spring roll consisted of coarsely chopped cabbage and lots of black pepper. The Szechwan chicken was covered in this brown soy ""gravy."" 

On the plus side, they used white meat chicken in both dishes and you could tell that they were made fresh.

I just think they need some help in the preparation of these dishes...or add more seasonings and hold up on all the soy sauce on everything."
1689927,best japanese buffet hands down!!!  awesome!!! best ever I'\ve experienced...
804202,the food was meh and service was very slow!!
1891740,"I quit going to Pesos several years ago because the fish was fishy and the food generally not good. Well we decided to try it again. I have to say, the food has improved a lot. I've been back twice. It doesn't strike me as the cleanest place with the friendliest staff but for a quick bite it's fine. Now if they could only put soap in the women's bathroom, life would be grand. Both times, the dispenser was empty."
1210919,"My quest for finding really good burgers in the metro area is not as urgent as it once was. I finally am finding some good burger joints I can wholeheartedly embrace.
I am always on the lookout though so I can refer to a handful of restaurants with good burgers and any other food genre for that matter. I don't like having one 'go to' place for burgers or whatever, I like to have several!
I have driven down Pacific enough times now to notice Mary's Burger Bistro and decided to give it a try.
I got the Fiesta Burger.
Steve got the Cod Burger.
My burger was alright but the peppers that came on my burger did not seem fresh and the overall burger was just not so vibrant.
Steve's Cod Burger I actually liked better. It had a pretty good flavor to it.
The French Fries here were probably the best part to eating here. They had a nice texture to them!
Service is good and friendly but I don't feel that the burgers are of the gourmet variety here."
1647228,"We came here using a Groupon deal for a dinner for 2 with a carafe of house wine, and we had a great experience. We were a little late for our reservations, but they were running a little late themselves so it worked out perfectly. Between the 2 of us we had the bruschetta, pear and gorgonzola salad, grilled chicken breast and veggies, sausage risotto, chocolate truffles, and the ricotta cake with berry sauce. The flavors were good, although the risotto I thought was light on the sausage, and they were very generous with the house wine (the red was quite good, too). But the portion sizes for the meal were ridiculous. The chicken breast was half of the smallest chicken breast I have ever seen atop 4 baby carrots. I mean, it was so small we laughed about it later. That, and they were out of a couple of the dishes we were excited to try (the house-made spumoni, for example). All-in-all, we though it was a good experience considering the price we paid with the Groupon."
844634,"We found a Groupon for this restaurant while on vacation and decided to give it a try.  They served us the most delicious Middle Eastern food we've ever eaten, no small feat since we live in the Detroit area with a huge number of Middle Eastern restaurants.

The appetizers were fresh and superbly prepared and presented.  Main entrees were ample portions of exquisitely seasoned kebabs.  The meat and rest of the kebabs were excellent as one would expect but even the rice had outstanding flavor.  Add to this fantastice service and presentation and no rating other than five star is appropriate.

The restaurant isn't much to look at on the surface but be sure to try it - you'll be glad you did!"
822329,"My dining experience wasn't typical. I'd come here with a group for a going away party which had a chef's choice extravaganza. Thus I shall rate the extravaganza's offering, and the service with it.

So I'm mostly an east side sushi guy. This may (and should) modify your opinion of my expectations. There are very few places on the east side with decent fish. I only have a couple places on the east side that seem worth it.

So our extravaganza included such tasty morsels such as:
sake (salmon)
amaebi (raw shrimp)
uni (sea urchin)
butter fish
scallop
some rolls of which I didn't know the nome of
and others.
a sort of dessert sushi, which was a hand roll with rice paper, and inside, unagi, cucumber and tamago.

The highlights were certainly the uni, and dessert, but all were magnificent. The fish was as close to perfection as I'd ever had. 

I'll admit that I've had uni once about 6 years ago, and I swear I'd never have it again. It was the most foul thing I'd ever put in my mouth. This is coming from someone who's had hÃ¡karl (fermented Icelandic shark).  Well J knows how to serve. He had a plate with one for the whole party. 7 piece of uni in nigiri style. I gave it another chance and I can say I've had good uni. It feels like a curse has been lifted.

The amaebi had an interesting twist. A quail egg on top. Now I don't believe I've had raw quail egg on anything, but it really did the amaebi a service is taming some of the bitterness that can come with it with the egg yolk. Nicely played.

Also the scallop which normally is a pretty bland and or dry piece of sushi at many places. Jay does it nigiri style with a clear sort of sauce on top that really brings out the flavor of the scallop. I'd heard of this from said friend going away. To experience it was living up to the promise of what a nigiri scallop could offer.

J himself came out and made sure we were all doing well, and struck up some conversation. I always admire a personable sushi chef who's willing to talk and listen.

All in all I have to give J's five stars. The meal he put on was one I'll remember forever. He's so very passionate about good service and good food. 5 stars all the way."
802805,"What I was served would have been perfect...if I'd been at the Bite of Seattle.  For just under $12, what you get is a snack.

I ordered a full-sized turkey with artichoke panini, and a full-sized bowl (not cup) of broccoli cheddar soup.  After a hectic day at work, without a spare minute for lunch, I was ready to EAT, dammit.

The portion sizes were skimpy and sad.  I got a panini about the size of a beverage coaster, and about 10 oz. of soup.  The panini contained about an ounce of turkey, a couple of spinach leaves, and some stray grilled onions, cemented by a thin grout of artichoke spread.

The quality of the ingredients seemed good.  The Thumbelina-sized turkey pile was thick-sliced, and seemed to have been cut from an actual bird, instead of one of those processed loaf turkeys that even the Audubon Society has never actually seen in the wild.  The soup was a little on the lukewarm and congealed side, but was flavorful and loaded with soft, little broccoli florets.

That meal should have been double the size it was.  That's my opinion.  Screw this pikerish, mean-spirited, passive-aggressive stinginess about portion sizes, and hand-wringing about the size of other people's bodies and what they're putting in their mouths.  When you have guests come visit your home or restaurant, go generous or go piss up a rope.  If you don't want to feed people a satisfying meal, do us a favor, and don't run a restaurant or invite people to your home."
815012,Dropped in to get some lunch on a random Thursday. The Wreck is delicious. I consider myself to be a big eater so the sandwich left me wanting more but mostly because of its quality. I probably would have ate too much had I been given the resources. There is a sauce on the sandwich which seemed very similar to Thousand Island but it was great with the hot peppers. The chocolate chip oatmeal cookies are amazing and cooked perfectly.
503202,"I am in love with their quiche and the junction croissant. The prices are a bit high but well worth it for a delicious croissant with ham, cheese, and eggs. They have other delicious items they will serve your sweet tooth. Their macaroons are also delicious, especially the pistachio!"
1272620,"Bee bee que. Barbie Cue. BB Who? huh.

Located in the smallest neck of the woods in Washington State is this wonderful gem for the hungriest carnivores in the land. Mike's is a local BBQ shop, with some mind blowing, tender loving flavors going on.

My very large family were staying in Port Gamble for the weekend and were very very hungry after wedding prep that day. The eateries walking distance from our cabins were few and far between, so Mike's was one of our only options in the area. 

Caught the restaurant a half hour before they closed, but because of their vast popularity, they food supply was low. Thankfully, the owner was so so gracious, and gave us what goodies they had left at the end of the day. We got a grand amount of food for a great deal, and we are so so so thankful!

Ribs, chicken, fries, slaw, bread. Considering that this large meal was when they were out of most of the food puts into perspective how many people and meals they serve every day. There was about 16-17 hungry cousins, but we all left stuffed and more than satisfied when we left. The ribs are extremely meaty and their sauces are delicious. Their fries and chicken were on point as well! The quality of the food was wonderful, the service was even more than that.

Thank you for the amazing service and delicious food! I wish this place were closer to the man areas of Washington, this would be on my ""must go again"" list... eh even with the far distance, it's on my must-go-again list. 

Yup, that good."
922683,"The atmosphere was nice, food was ok but the service was lacking and VERY slow.  Getting a drink took 30"", prob won't go back."
841084,"I am only basing my review on a 1 time experience and my order was to go. I ordered 2 burgers and by the time I got home (about 8 minutes away) the buns were so mushy that I had to eat it with a fork, it was far more greasy than other places i have tried. I will update this if I ever decide to sit down and eat."
774295,"So good, ive been here a few times now, and every time i am greeted by the nicest dude (cant recall his name, but a genuinely nice guy).  Ive ordered gyros, and swarma plates and they are so amazing.  there is limited seating, and i live like 4 blocks away so i get mine to go."
181416,"Been here 5 times at least.  Still don't know how to pronounce the name.  I like how the manager/founder is always around and always looking for something to do, or somebody that needs help.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Attentive staff.  I saw many people here getting lunch on Seahawks gameday.  My favorite is wonton EGG noodle.  Do not get that boring RICE noodle that they use in Vietnamese pho.  They also have a big TV in the back, and have beer specials on seahawks gameday that is an away game.  
The food is really a mash up of asian food.  It is not really cambodian food.  Dont get me wrong, it is better like that and I like having more choices.  But its far from traditional Cambodian food.  Price is very fair and both portions and quality is very good.  Just have an idea of what your ordering, they have many pictures of the menu items, or else you could be disappointed with your SouthEast Asian mash up mixed plate stir fry.

NO parking. keep that in mind."
807901,"This is probably one of my favorite noodle houses in Seattle.  Typical Vietnamese restaurant, food comes out quick and it is very tasty.  There is a Renton location if you don't want to deal with parking in Chinatown (downtown)

The fried chicken wing appetizer is the best fried chicken in Seattle..Period!  It is a must definite try when visiting here."
206243,"Authentic (recommended to me by someone from France). Small portions enough for one but savory, don't think you'd want more. Dessert was delicious. Decadent chocolate tart, mmmmmm! I got the pork cheeks dish which I would only recommend to someone who wants a hearty meal in the winter. Ya feel me? ;) my bf got the steak which was cooked perfectly, no need for dipping sauce or added seasonings. 

The server was attentive, knowledgeable, and pronounced everything correctly. Way to be! :)

We were tucked away in a corner which was nice since we were on a date. The table was reserved for us when we came in, felt special. 

Great food, great service, great ambience.

Sardine salad was delish! 
Steak frite.
Um chocolate tart.
All their wines are amazing!"
782732,Short and sweet.  Waited two hours for an unhelpful waitress and average food?  Are you kidding me?
674536,"I don't know what took me so long to write this review, I've been going here for happy hour since they first opened! I used to eat here so much i think i overdosed on if and had to take a break.(: 

I feel like a lot has changed since they first started out, portions for happy hour are a lot smaller and service is a hit or miss but it's still a great place to grab a bite to eat. 

They have an awesome happy hour menu that runs everyday 3-6 and than 10 till midnight. I've had everything on their happy hour menu and I think the best items would be the: calamari, chipotle beef bites, wedge salad and the chicken taquitos. These are honestly some of the best taquitos I've ever had! Crispy, Crunchy, and just the right amount of kick. They're filled with chicken and have this amazing green sauce with crema on top..mmmm!  Everything else is pretty standard, the tacos are a little underwhelming and the soup is nasty. 

Azuls makes an awesome Sangria!!....and they are only $5! I can seriously drink 3 of those because they're so tasty and I'm usually a light drinker. I liked it so much I emailed them asking for the recipe!  They also make awesome Lemondrops. I like the strawberry ones.

They have a pretty good dinner menu as well. First of all the chips and salsa here are wonderful! They come complimentary with dinner but I thin $2 during HH.   I really like their Carne Asada, it's beefy, juicy, and has a nice charbroiled flavor. They serve it a bit differently than what you would expect from Carne Asada at most places but it's great. The fajitas are good and so are the salads and sandwiches. They make an excellent Cobb Salad and the Carne Asada Sandwich is tasty. The Burrito here is massive and very filling but delicious as well.

The ambiance and decor is pretty nice. However it can get a little too loud and crowded on the weekends especially late at night. Definitely a good place to grab a drink and a bite to eat if your up North not to mention excellent happy hour."
252681,"I don't give many 5* but I must say this is a rare find. 
Like many reviewers before me don't let the outside fool (you or the in for that matter).
Came in because I had a groupon and I like a good gyro. 

You have the option to get food to go or sit down. I was in no rush and decided to dine in. The waitress was friendly and quick.

So my goal of obtaining a gyro took a detour. When I got there and did my Yelp check in! My lovely app told me I get free baklava with an entree. Heck yeah I want some free Baklava!

Between my friend and I we planned out our food choices. She ended up getting the lamb kabab entree. Which for only like $9 you get a heck of a lot of food. You get the 2 skewers of lamb kabab plus hummus and pita bread a side salad and basamati rice! And ofcourse the free baklava!

I opted for the lamb kabab sandwich. (For only 4.99 and for $2 get a side of fries and a drink). I know I came for a gyro but the kabab sounded good. And I was not disappointed. I have had kababs before other places and I have to tell you they got the seasonings in this one. Other places barely can tell they seasoned. The kabab was flavorful with a nice little bit of char from the grill and not dry. Talk about good eats.

The basamati rice  lacked a bit of flavor but eatting with the kabab and some hot chili paste made it alright. 

I will return for that gyro! or Chicken swarshma which means I will have to make another trip."
208543,"I went here twice for happy hour.

The first, it was with my best friend and I had a blast. Their happy hour menu, though plentiful did not offer a lot of large sized portions, so we also ordered a la carte. 

I had their salmon sashimi and the portions and cuts were of fresh quality. Their sushi rolls are large: the kind you'd find if you ate at Umi's Sake House. My friend ordered the calamari and it came with a salad, which was refreshing. We also tried one of their salads, a smoked salmon arugula salad with cherry tomato and feta cheese in a creamy hazelnut vinaigrette dressing, topped off with toasted hazelnuts. It was good, the flavors were there, however it was too sweet since there was not enough acidity. We asked for wedges of lemon and after squeezing it on the salad, it tasted a lot better. The only thing that was off-putting was the feta cheese, which did not add much to the salad. 

The second time I went to dine here for happy hour with a couple of friends, I noticed that their options were cut down. The portion sizes were also devastating with large contrast in quantity and quality. The sushi rolls on their happy hour menu was sub par at most; the flavors: not memorable. 

The service is always pleasant and courteous even if the waiters do not appear at your table every 10 minutes to ask about your meal. 

The bottom line: if you want to come here for happy hour, come for the drinks, not the food. If you do want food, I would suggest ordering from their a la carte menu instead of the happy hour menu; there's more variety and the quality of food is much better."
1933591,"Go early!!  They open at 10 but get there by 9:45 to avoid ridiculous wait times.  The food is outstanding, especially the ""juicy pork"" wontons (eat them in one bite or the juice spills out).  Get the shaved ice with fruit for dessert.  I'm not a fan of the taro or red bean but it is awesome!"
789450,Food delicious. Atmosphere friendly and welcoming. Interior decor was modern and spaced out well but you will be sitting close enough to hear your neighbor diners chit-chat.
162193,"Warning: seagulls can be EXTREMELY loud. 

When I say extreme, I mean it.

My friend and I stopped by here for lunch. It was a rare sunny day in Seattle and we decided to sit outside. 

Correction: it was a day with rare sun-break in Seattle. 

We tried the white clam chowder, scallops 'n chips, and shrimp cocktail. The scallops were amazing! The chowder was especially good, too. The shrimp cocktail was okay. I have had a similar dish at SF Fisherman's Wharf and the flavor there was better. The shrimp cocktail was full of cocktail sauce flavor. It just wasn't very good. If anything, it almost felt like a tourist trap where the scallops serving was pretty small. Although my friend and I were happy with the entree, we just felt like they could be a bit more generous with the serving. Soda is $2 and you get free refill.

So the seagulls. We decided to sit outside because it was kind of dry outside. The seagulls were so loud. At first, we hesitated but didn't think it could be that bad. But after 5 minutes, it got a bit too loud. The seagulls don't seem that loud if you are only there for like a couple of minutes. But if you sit there for over 10 minutes, you may want to reconsider your options. The seagulls are extremely good at catching fries mid-air. We would gently throw fries at them and almost all of them could catch the fries. They are loud. Just be warned."
882245,We ordered a Lamb Souvlaki Pita. It was strictly OK; the meat was bland and didn't appear to be marinated well. The portion was small too.
812090,"Never coming back, service was horrible

Walked in with boyfriend and seated ourselves down. After a length of time we decided to get the attention of a waiter, big mistake.

We asked the server if we were in the right area and without making any eye-contact he replies back with a very sarcastic tone as if we had committed some type of error in asking him a question because its not like he works there or anything.

After that unnecessary attitude we decided to take our BBQ journey elsewhere, good BBQ is ubiquitous in Seattle and good service is as well, do not bother with a place that treats their customers badly."
1513930,"Came here with friends after the boat show. We had to keep flagging down our waitress and ask for our water glasses to be refilled. The food and drinks were ok, but the service was awful."
1874890,Food was good but the waitress was really pushy and messed up our birthday surprise check.... But you should def order the Merry Christmas pizza
1089157,"Over the years I have seen this location transition to many types of restaurants. Last night was the first time I have step foot in this awesome establishment run by Mike Chang the owner. I was here for a business meeting and I pretty much let my client do all the ordering since it was my first time here. They ordered Poke Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Fries over gravy as appetizers then came the main dishes of Mochi Chicken, Beef Bulgolgi, Chicken and Beef Teriyaki, and Curry Chicken. Of all the food ordered I was not prepared to see the hefty portions on each dish and I got a good fill of all the dishes with quite a bit left over. Every dish I tasted was amazing in taste and the way the meat was cooked where it wasn't dry or undercooked but it was a nice texture of both chicken and beef.  I am extremely thankful for my client to pay for dinner and wish all my clients had meetings at restaurants :p 

I highly recommend checking out this hole in the wall restaurant in the UW area and trying the dishes I have listed and explore the other dishes as well. I will be coming back here soon and try their dessert.....yeah thats how full I was with the amount of food that was served I had no room for dessert.

Happy Eats everyone!!"
1347897,"Heard about this place and gave it a try.  Got there for Happy Hour and they have a good menu for that.  Ordered a few things off the Happy Hour menu and an entree.  Everything was good, the best was the crab won tons.  The peanut sauce on several items tasted a little bland and I was surprised they did not ask how spicy we wanted it,  I think it could have been spicier."
946042,"The food is Amazing. Very Friendly too.. If I could eat there every day, I would. :)"
867474,"My friend and I were meeting for happy hour one night and I told her to pick the place.  She said how about Top of Tacoma Bar.  Initially I looked at the address and was like really?  Why does she want to go there?  But I went along with it.  I showed up and the place was packed!  As I sat there waiting for her, I read the reviews and holy crap, this place had awesome reviews!  We went on a Thursday so all the mexican type food was half off.  We got a regular sized order of the nachoes which was huge and really really good.  From the reviews, it seems like all their food is really good so I'm sure I'll be back to try something elseon the menu!  Don't be afraid of the location and check it out for yourself!"
1320144,"I had the Vietnamese Burger and Chile Fries.  The burger was amazing and even though it is the monthly special I hope they continue to sell it FOREVER :)

The food was  pricey for what it was but overall I enjoyed the meal!"
2154505,"Yum! I was here for the happy hour and had one of everything. The fish is fresh which is the biggest thing in a sushi restaurant. The short ribs were thinner than I prefer but good. It was flooded that night and I think there was only one waitress! Poor thing, she was extremely pleasant and kind even with all the chaos :)"
2811037,"Went here with a group of about 8 people for lunch and it was incredible. They were really busy for lunch, but the service was still top notch. Our server was personable, friendly, and was more than happy to offer suggestions and answer questions. 
One thing that really stood out was that one of the members of our party has a nut allergy, so the server went out of his way to remove nuts or put any peanut sauces on the side of dishes so that we could still all share. It was so nice and awesome of him to remember that throughout the whole meal (as we had several courses). 
They also had plenty of options for vegan and vegetarians which was a big plus. 
Definitely recommend!"
1684319,"I'm confused. This food costs a lot of money. But I wouldn't be able to fill up, even if I ordered TWO entrees. Sorry, but no. The only thing worth ordering here is the burger, and I don't like beef, so I always just watch in envy as my friend chows down on  a filling meal.

I will admit that the food is good, but not good enough for me to spend over $50 to not be hungry anymore. Small plates, fine, but the entrees are what I would consider small plates. I admit I limit myself to seafood and vegetarian options, but honestly, I expect lots of veggie on my plate when I spend this kind of money. They don't even need to be fancy.

I would come back for the cocktails, and the bartender on the nights I came was a total sweetheart. But for dinner, hell naw. It's rare that I'm perplexed and upset just because I looked at my food."
860492,"My review probably falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. You can't beat the prices here for the quality of food, especially at lunchtime. I ordered the Bimbo's burrito with a PBR and had to get a to-go container for the last bit of my burrito! For such a cheap meal, it was both filling and delicious (especially with a ton of their jalapeno hot sauce).

I read some other reviews on here before going and am impressed by how badly everyone speaks of the service. They were nice and attentive. No one came by with a tray to sweep up our crumbs after every bite, but again -- go with reasonable expectations. It's a divey sort of place. Cool decor (lots of lucha libre) and cheap eats. They have excellent portions and nice staff. What's not to like, for what it is?"
778106,"Craving clams!?

Then come down to 13 Coins and order Buckets and Buckets of Clams! I've always loved this place for their clams cooked in pesto sauce. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for your bread. SOOO good! The portion sizes are big here, so my date and I shared the Half Spaghetti, Half Beef Ravioli. Unfortunately, I can't say many good things about it. Somewhat bland and the sauce was watery."
414509,"Great drinks, great service, and yummy food! The also have very nice happy hour prices."
822057,"My boyfriend and I visited here just today and we had a great experience! I ordered the chili cheese fries and my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger. Both of our orders were fantastic, the chili was delicious with great seasoning, the cheese was perfectly melted and gooey and the fries were some of the best I've had! definitely coming back here again in the future if we ever want to go eat out somewhere."
1209585,"Felt like a classic steak and deep fried shrimp dinner at a reasonable price so i stopped in at Denny's.  I had the sirloin steak medium-rare, with the shrimp added.
The steak was surprisingly good; the shrimp were just what you'd expect, and just what i wanted, and the veggies and rice were just fine.  Good service too."
1122151,"Paseo's cuban food is one of a kind in its community location  & its generous portions of food.  I've been going there whenever I want a hearty hot sandwich as a reward.  Thre wrap with the scallops & shrimp is  escpecially delicious and light on your digestive system.

I enjoy the funkie  small restaurant space that is built into the remants of an old deserted garage.  They are sitting on prime real estate on Freemon Ave close by to the south end of the zoo.
Thier food is sensual, messy at times and delicous to eat.  The service is a little on the slower side because they are so swamped with customers, especially during lunch or dinner hrs.  The eway to avoid all that and the line ups is to order your food on the phone & come pick it up."
886227,"This place has been around for ages and for good reason.  The outdoor seating can't be beat, and the location is great.  The food is tasty and they have lots of drinks to choose from.  The one thing keeping this place from getting more stars is that the service tends to be very hit and miss.  I've had good servers, but I've also had some pretty rude ones as well.  Nothing sours a meal like bad service."
1020192,"Great food and super friendly service - we'll be back. Don't let the way it looks deceive you!

P.S. I can normally handle spicy food so I asked for my dish to be a 4 out of 5 on the hot scale and it was incredibly spicy!"
2162119,"Awesome chowder! Perfect for lunch. The Cascadia chowder could use a little more spice, but that's a personal preference."
1757266,"So much deliciousness!

Fast (REALLY!)

Affordable

Super-nice Peeps

Open almost ALWAYS. 

EPIC."
1331368,My wife bought me a Famous Hot Reuben and it was the best I've ever had. I've been a Reuben connoisseur for years. I Ike them thick and juicy with a nice balance of lean and fatty corned beef. Goldberg's got it perfect. I can't wait to get one for game day weekend.
1707817,"Just stopped by there today and if you want the best rib tips ever...then come on down. Pookie was a real nice guy and helped modify our order as he thought we were buying TOO much...LOL. Best rib tips period. Ribs are excellent as well. We look forward to coming back soon. Be nice to Pookie...he keeps saying he is ""old as dirt"" =)"
1111094,"First off (because it infuriated me to read them) to answer to any bad service reviews:

Uncle Mike's is run by REAL people. Meaning they treat you just like you treat them. I am always happy to see Uncle Mike and tell him so and I have never gotten a hint of bad service any time I've been ever there. However, I have been present when a customer was rude, snappy and ungrateful and ol' U.M. was having none of it. And rightly so. 

That being said:

You would be stupid not to eat here. There is also no way that you can eat any pork item off of Mike's menu without moaning inappropriately and the thing is, you don't care. It's that good. Unbutton the top button on your pants in public good, no matter what you order. When I used to work close by, no one was allowed to mention ""superlicious bbq"" unless they were prepared to make a run, because otherwise, all you'd be able to think about all day is making sloppy love to a rack of ribs. This is not an exaggeration. Go. Today. And tip generously."
1194977,"This was so good that we went back two nights in a row. We had completely different dishes each night, and both nights was AMAZING. Wonderful Spinach & Chanterelle Mushroom Salad, the best steak I have ever had ""RR Ranch Tenderloin"", and a chocolate dessert that I still dream about. I am normally not a fan of chocolate dessert, I think most are simply too sweet. This was chocolate perfection. It was called ""Down the Rabbit Hole"", and I truly felt like Alice in Wonderland eating that dessert, it was simply magical."
1292266,"I'm pretty sure this place totally ripped me off, unless Manny's beer is actually 7.50 per pint.... Which either way is absolutely ridiculous. 2 well drinks and 2 Manny's should not cost a total of $31.00. I'm kicking myself for not contesting it. My friend's band played there and other people I was with did not get charged that much. What gives, Slim's? I was told that well drinks were $5.25, and doubles were 10.50. I assumed Manny's would be maybe $4.50 at the most since that's the average price EVERYWHERE ELSE.

Super disappointed, as I really would have liked to come here again otherwise. Thanks for being so untrustworthy, it saves me a trip to Georgetown in the future."
1321131,"I'm giving Zippy's five stars. Is that because they're perfect? No; their onion rings are not bad, but not all that great either. And the service isn't all that friendly. But their burgers are FANTASTIC. Five-star fantastic. And their fries and tots are really good too. And the prices are low. And they have good beer; even an IPA on tap. People complain that the burgers take a long time to come out, but heck, they even tell you that ahead of time if you bother to check their website. And the somewhat surly service isn't really a big deal to me; they still get you what you need and they aren't rude about it. So if you want a fantastic burger place that's cheap and also serves beer, and you don't mind waiting for it, this is the place."
2789614,"I order in lunches for our office every week, and I've never had an experience like this! Not only did Chad from homegrown call to confirm the orders, but he asked a lot of clarifying questions and made suggestions to ensure what we were given was just right. We have a lot of food allergies in our office (gluten free/dairy free), and he was able to make suggestions that would suit everyone.  He even threw in some GF cookies, which I didn't even know they had! Lunch hasn't been delivered yet--it's scheduled for a couple days from now, but I'm excited to see what it's like when it gets here!"
156484,"Service 5-star
Cuisine 4.5-star
Presentation 4.5-star
Ambiance 4-star

STARTERS/ENTREES
Diver scallops (5-star) - perfectly seared, gorgeous scallops. A beautiful entree.
House smoked salmon (5-star) - gorgeously plated salmon, super fresh. Large starter.
Salmon mousse (4-star) - the mousse was impossibly airy and daintily presented, a very unique preparation. 
Saffron Clams (3-star) - while the preparation was unique and the crispy pork was tasty by itself, it overpowered the garlic-tomato broth, which was a bit salty and didn't  complement the clams. 

DESSERTS
Meyer lemon semifreddo (4-star) - a refreshing option, delicious and light.  Recommend.
Ginger Stout Cake (3-star) served with citrus confit, chocolate stout ice cream - the stout was barely discernible in both the cake (dry on the edges, bland) and the ice cream. Skip this.

SERVICE
Stephanie provided fantastic service throughout our evening and made our experience memorable and enjoyable. We met several members of the staff, all of whom were pleasant and professional. Service was swift and well-paced.

AMBIANCE
The re-done Ray's is sleeker and more awake, while preserving select nautical elements.  

Look forward to returning for special occasions."
1162027,"great pizza joint, sort of randomly situated in the international district, but friendly staff and good slices. you wouldn't realize it was all completely vegetarian unless you paid attention. which really doesn't change anything at all."
1688111,They have poor customer service to certain people. The place is cold and dirty..
1340564,"What was clearly a chef screw up turned out to be our favorite part of the meal. 

We ordered the special- a Mortadella Pizza- and added mushrooms and pickled peppers (sounds good right?). We watched the chef make the pizza, only to have the server see that both the mushrooms and peppers had been omitted when he'd retrieved it from the oven. The chef added these items and put the pizza back in the oven for another blast of heat. The result? A perfectly crispy and charred pizza that we thoroughly enjoyed. It was one of the best pizzas we've had in a long time.

We ordered another pizza to follow (the balsamic onion and Gorgonzola) that didn't have two rounds of cooking- and the result was a delicious but decidedly limp & sloppy pizza that wasn't nearly as good as the second one. We know next time to ask for the pizza to have a little more time in the oven. Suggest you do the same if you visit.

The beers on tap are nice- the selection is very good and they have some rare and unusual selections. They are pricey though- so be forewarned- some pints are over $10. They have wine too (my wife had a lovely glass of Red)- but no liquor.

If you're're in Lower Queen Anne and looking for Pizza and Beer in a pretty chill environment- The Masonry is a very good option."
1677835,"Hands down BEST Mexican food in the area. EVERYTHING on the menu is excellent, and it's real, traditional style Mexican. No chips (don't even ask...), and no ""fajitas"". You owe it to yourself to at least try this place once. La Tarasca is in a class by itself. I love the chicken mole..."
2460673,"Baked goods are great.  Not so much their delivery drivers.  You can catch the SOB running the stop sign at the Edmonds circle at 5:50 in the morning; high speed up Main street and then a sharp right at the circle on to 5th.  Crosswalk/stop sign be damn.  Have emailed the bakery and owner... no response.

Bill H."
2166209,"This place does not welcome large groups!!! I rarely write reviews, but really felt compelled to let others know to avoid this place if you have a large party (we had 10). We went on a Sunday and got there before they opened since they don't take reservations. The staff were great about seating and serving us right away, though.

Everyone already knows about the pasta from reading other reviews, but I ordered the beet salad and am confident to say that it was the worst I've ever had. I don't discriminate when it comes to vegetables, but they added salt, which overpowered the rest of the flavors! The menu did state that it did have sea salt, but I didn't expect it to be that much.

To make matters worse, the waitress gave me serious attitude for only ordering a salad. I'm sorry, but is it a problem that I don't feel like walking out of your hodgepodge restaurant with a food baby? Not to mention, I ordered what I thought was an entree salad, so I don't know where the attitude came from. This did not add to the great impression I was getting as I was seated right in front of a chalkboard that said, ""Nobody is 'fine' with just water"". So, it's NOT okay if I prefer not to order from your selection of alcoholic, caffeinated, or sugar-infested beverages? Maybe I am 'fine' with just water...

This place is 'cozy', meaning you will have very little elbow room while you eat. They crammed as many tables as possible into this place so you can barely walk through. I had my purse on my chair and the waitress kept ramming into it every time she walked by. At one point I moved it onto my lap, but that didn't help because she continued to bump my chair. Please keep in mind that I don't take up much space as I'm $1.12 and was scooted in as far as I could go to try to avoid getting ambushed every time. 

Finally, we asked for our bill to be split, but they refused and said they would only take up to 4 cards for payment. NOT cool. This is the city, and there are lots of single people that gather together for dinner! To not split a tab is ludicrous! After struggling to find a way to work it out among ourselves, the waitress came back and said we were $20 short! She charged the cards, of course, but brought the cash back with the tab, told us to figure it out and then walked away. Then she came back and said she found the missing money and that it somehow had gotten 'stuck' to something. 

Unwelcoming waitstaff + terrible attitudes + unaccommodating environment = unpleasant experience. Isn't the goal of your restaurant to draw in business rather than discourage it? So bizarro..."
837367,"They have moved to a larger restaurant space, still in the same shopping center.
This place is awesome. Kind of pricey. 
My husband likes the carne asada burrito.
I love the tacos, get the 4 taco meal, and you can pick out 4 different meats.
They are a 99% lard free establishment, so the beans don't taste heavy. 
The new location has a huge bar and good selection of spirits. 
I highly recommend this place, the flavors are very authentic and unlike most Mexican restaurants, every thing tastes different, instead of same mush different wrapper. 
Food comes out very quickly after you order so no waiting."
944449,"Really enjoy Stans location, atmosphere, and the people working there. Went there for a beer and some wings both were great no question but what I really enjoyed was being able to have a friendly chat with not only the staff but the locals around me. Turned out to be blast - I'll go there again in the next week or so as usual.

Upon reading some of the other poor reviews on the place I can agree that though their BBQ is good it's not like you're getting it straight from the south... but hey, it's the northwest I'm not expecting world class BBQ. Maybe a good entrepreneurial opportunity?"
902829,What a cute little meat market that doubles as a sandwich shop. The butchershop had beautiful cuts of meat (a little pricey but expected) and the sandwich shop offers great grilled sandwiched and fries. I had the pulled pork and enjoyed it very much.
1914413,"Well priced, good japanese food! Be sure to call ahead and make reservations...otherwise there's a little bar where they can seat first come, first serve. Had the chirashi bowl, tho I still prefer Musashi's, and the black miso cod which was delicious!"
1085977,"If this is what people eat in New York, no wonder they're so cranky.  When I saw the deal on LivingSocial, I assumed there was a reason, but bought it anyway.  I had never been to New York Pizza & Bar, so I thought I'd give them a chance.

The service was good except for when we asked if we could use our voucher on drinks (it only said we couldn't use it on happy hour), were told yes, and then saw otherwise when we got the bill.  That resulted in us not getting to redeem $4 of the voucher.  If there's one thing I love, it's being cheated out of money.

The food was just average.  Certainly nothing I would ever want again.  I had a long island which was missing coke.  I prefer to think of it as a ""mixed booze sour"".  It was disgusting.  The pizza was just ok.  It was a little darker on the bottom than I would have liked, and kind of bland.  My friend's pizza was supposed to come with cilantro, but that was missing.

I don't think this restaurant will last long in Queen Anne.  It looks fancy on the outside, but on the inside, it's just an average pizza bar with college style drinks and jello shots.  Pass."
1447653,"I went here on a Wednesday night at 11. The place was still abuzz and everyone was dressed up! There was music and a general atmosphere of cheer.  The service was on the slow side but acceptable. The Dungeness crab and shrimp enchiladas were too cheesey - the crab, shrimp and salsa were untasteable. I did like the black beans. My friend had the fish tacos, the spicy ones. They were good - the marinated onions added a little oomph! 

Overall, a safe bet and I'll come here again."
1777231,"We started going here years ago, and a few years ago I would have given it 4 stars. I'm not sure what happened to the food but everything taste extra corn starched and a bit sour like. 

I don't know how to explain it. We use to go here about twice a month, but now we are back to maybe once every 6 months.

There are some dishes here that are good and some I don't recommend.

The unique lamb hot pot is great if you like lamb, and the fried fish was good. 

Service is good though and that is rare at Chinese restaurants. Given the location and  availability of Chinese Restaurants in Renton, it isn't a bad choice if you need to come here."
668466,"I was really disappointed in the food here. As a bar, it's a fun place - so I'm giving it three stars. As for the actual bar food - all I can say is ""bland."" 
I had the vegan chili - and while it looked like it would be delicious - it was seriously lacking flavor, and it's not b/c it was vegan! It had some spice to it, but it still was missing some real flavor. Additionally, the two crackers that come with it were an unsatisfying combination. Give me some cornbread or a roll.
My friends and I also ordered the green salad. Ok, perhaps this is our own fault but for $4.95 - the green salad is JUST THAT. A small handful of spring lettuce mix with some dressing. No tomatoes, no carrots, no extras. A HUGE ripoff.

My friend ordered the penne - and it also was very bland. However, my other friend ordered the minimum wage burger and she was quite happy with it.

I'd probaby stick to the burgers here...the other food was just boring."
180811,"This is a great place if you are looking for a very nice sit down dinner.  The prices were reasonable for a slightly upscale restaurant.  

Went here for dinner from a friend's recommendation.  The place looked very nice, and we ate in what looked like a small greenhouse.

Our waiter was VERY friendly and very helpful with the menu and wine list.  They have a very good wine list, with most of the wine from their winery.

The menu was relatively small, but its expected for a place like this.  Prices were probably 10-15 for an appetizer, and 20-30 for an entree.  

The food was spectacular.  The portion size was not very large, but you probably won't be going here to load up on food.

The staff didn't rush us through are dinner, and gave us time to enjoy our food and drinks.

The place was pretty fully, so I think making reservations is a must.  I would definitely go back here if I wanted a nice night out."
1321459,"So happy I came here. The line might look daunting but it moves very quickly. 

My boyfriend and I shared the clam chowder bread bowl and normally I'm a light eater but we both could have had our own and been fine. 

I had the salmon chowder as well but didn't like it as much as the clam. 

MUST go for visitors."
1724503,"Now this is must stop location in Leavenworth. A delicious Ginger snap cookie with an espresso on a cold winter day is just amazing. 

It is an absolutely tiny place though so be careful walking in.  Opening the door you might hit some body."
1779027,"My boyfriend and i wanted to eat somewhere casual and so our hotel 123west recommended this place, which also happend to be right next door. its a very convenient location, right in the main area. we had dinner here and overall it was a good experience. We both got fish and chips and it was good, the fries tasted better than they looked and you got a good amount of food on the plate. We didnt tended to when we walked in and waited for a bit but after that the service was good, workers friendly"
2164293,"Best sandwiches in Seattle! Just wish they were open for more than for 4 weekday lunches.

In order of preference:
- Porchetta sandwich - pork is juicy, tender and so flavorful. The pork soaks into the bread and the whole thing is a fatty, delicious mess.
- Salami (Salumi) sandwich with mozzarella - the salami itself is peppery and perfectly salty and the mozzarella they use is fairly hearty. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, which is great on a sandwich roll with onions and peppers.
- Meatball sandwich with mozzarella - loved the sauce but would have preferred less dense meatballs. Still thought it was a great sandwich though pretty difficult to eat. 

On a cold Friday afternoon, the line started forming about 10 minutes before Salumi opened (at 11am) and there were at least 15-20 people in line when it opened. The line does move quickly though so know what you want!"
815792,"Izumi's has a nice Japanese atmosphere, but there food was too bland and somewhat overpriced. I had a veggie roll and spicy tuna roll. Both had little to no flavor, and when I saw the size of my seaweed salad I was shocked! Only about 2 tablespoons worth for $4! I'd rather go somewhere where I can leave feeling full and that my money was well spent. However, it was very fresh and the restaurant was clean."
670412,"Well, our old favorite sushi place closed down (RIP Sushi Ten, I will miss your ""all you can eat sushi"" for $25). My Dad went on and on about this place, and I blew him off...numerous times *hangs head low*. 
My Dad asked me out to dinner to catch up, he suggested John Howie. I said booya lets go. Half way there, he said ""You know, screw Howie, lets go Tuna House"" I agreed to try it. 
Best decision ever!

How's it possible to be soooo full on sushi, and still want more? It was delicious. We ordered about 8 different rolls between all 3 of us, all were insanely tasty. We got down on some miso soup- steaming hot. Diet coke comes in a can with a glass of ice.

Some of these rolls I could only probably come up with if I was high as a kite. Tons of ingredients, lots of mayo, and deep fried deep fry rolls. But they all worked and didn't come off as lazy or over the top. Volcano roll lives up to the hype and is ""erupting"" with lobster!

My favorite roll was the Salmon Nigiri... although it wasn't the most creative item on the menu and you can find it at any sushi joint, it was my top pick because it was so FRESH. I mean Fresh!! I questioned if they had a salmon tank in the back and sliced it up to order. 

Salmon Nigiri:::: Perfect marbling of fat, a touch of wasabi, and the rice... oh man the rice. I think I could be a poster child for this roll. Me, with my hair blown back a bit with a piece of salmon in my hand (just like the Kronos posters!!)

Still not convinced?

The service was outstanding. Every single employee in that restaurant was friendly, attentive, and quick.

If this is my last Yelp review ever, I must say I am glad it was Tuna House. You lose again, John."
2153998,"Good sushi, cocktails and trendy decour attract an ultra pretentious crowd. It is what it is!"
868557,"This joint is close to where we  now live, and based on the great reviews we decided to give it a try.  My review in a nutshell: overpriced, bland/underseasoned, americanized mexican slop.  Seriously, 4 stars?  The only thing I would give them 4 stars for is the service, which was bordering on overattentive.  But, friendly, good service nonetheless.  
My husband is from CA (nuff said), and I've been eating at a way more authentic mexican place in Monroe for 20 yrs, so our expectations were definitely leaning toward 'authentic' mexican food.  Not that much authenticity can even be found on the menu.  Regardless, I ordered a tamale and enchilada combo and hubby had a chile relleno and chimichanga combo.  We figured going this route we'd get at least one decent item (who screws up a chimichanga/enchilada?? It's not even real mexican food...)   Enchilada was basic but totally fine. I actually got to try both the chicken and the cheese, since they screwed up my order. Hubby thought chimi was standard, but nothing special. He was a little puzzled by the beans inside of it. We both tried the relleno, the true test of authentico mexican food, and it tasted possibly frozen or processed to me.  No bueno.  The tamale was a joke....there was literally 2 quarter sized pieces of meat in the entire thing, it was all cornmeal.  The drinks were another story.  Ordered the classic marg, waaaay heavy on the orange and just not that good.  Tons of ice and just not a good flavor.  My husband ordered a 2nd marg, the cadillac, which was better but nothing amazing.  Our bill w/o tip came to over $60 for this crap.  Really??  The only food item I can compliment was the pica de gallo, which was tasty.  The salsa? Meh. Chips were standard.  Just really an underwhelming experience.  If you think Azteca or Mazatlan have amazing mexican food, then you'll love this place, but we will not be back."

I enjoyed going so much that I made my friends come here for my birthday dinner. Since we were a large group we automatically were getting the chefs menu. I enjoyed it all and it's such a great deal for as many courses that you get."
226682,"I thoroughly enjoyed a winter culinary feast at lunch with a small group of friends. This quaint old-world parlor turned cozy French Bistro, is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. Tucked into the heart of Pike Place Market, Place Pigalle heralds an intriguing history dating back to the mid-century. I understand it survived its years as a brothel as well as several earthquakes. 

The atmosphere is somewhat eclectic and they seem to have a loyal following. Stunning views of Elliott Bay, The Olympic Mountain Range and surrounding areas are to be had from every table
.
The menu was extensive, the food fresh, and the service by Ellie (sp?) exemplary. We shared many of the artful dishes and these were my favorites:

* Onion Soup GratinÃ©e made with the best GruyÃ¨re and Hidalgo Cream Sherry. -My favorite outside of France!
* Delicious Steamed Mussels with Smoked Bacon, Celery, Shallots, and Balsamic Vinaigrette.
* Giant Dungeness Crab Cakes served with, Baguette Crostini, Seasonal Greens, Sweet and Spicy Mustard Vinaigrette. Slightly on the salty side but still nice.
* Amazing bouillabaisse ProvenÃ§ale with Prawns, Clams, Mussels, Dungeness Crab, Seasonal Fish, served in a Saffron-Tomato Broth, with Crostini Rouille
* A delightful Roasted Beet Salad was served warm and made with Baby Arugula, Toasted Walnuts, ChÃ¨vre, Shallots, and a Lemon-Dijon Vinaigrette.
Truly an extraordinary experience! - I'll be back for more!"
1169950,"Let's start with the charm as you walk up to the bright painted building. Then there is the staff that treats you like an old friend. And finally the food. Oh the food. You start with homemade bread and marionberry conserve. Be brave and try it. The butternut squash ravioli served with apples and onions in a light sauce is ""one of the best things I have ever ate."" The pot roast is so tender, rich and just stick to your bones kind of food. The cheeseburger is excellent with quality beef and Tillamook white cheddar, and a secret sauce that is spot on. Yes, you should go."
891879,"We had brunch here on a Sunday. Brunch and lunch are served on the Boat Street Kitchen side of the restaurant, but they seem to share a kitchen and a name, etc. 

It's cute and quaint, with small, rather cramped tables and European decor. It's a little bit pretentious, in all honesty, but our server was friendly enough and came by with frequent refills of coffee and water. That's all I can ask for on a Sunday morning. I had the Mushroom Duxelles scramble (tasty!) which was served with dressed greens and fresh bread. All very tasty. My husband had Duck Confit, which was delicious, served with a potato-carrot cake and beets. The menu isn't too big (a single page, including beverages, for brunch and lunch), and I was a little disappointed by that, but really, we came here because Toulouse Petit was opening late that day (unannounced). Not quite my cup of tea for brunch, but I suspect dinner here would be romantic and delicious."
1094253,"A guy without reservation, walked in after us and was told a 45 minute wait period was seated before us. What's the point of having a reservation? Phone battery died, lucky Buca. We were about to settle up this review for whatever it's worth just about to leave at 820 when we finally got our table. 

Hosts need better time management and lacked organization. We would much rather have those devices that blink letting you know your table is ready instead of asking, wondering all the time... we'll get you in asap blah blah. 

Despite the front house bad experience, once inside our waitress timed everything well, food very delicious, our compliments to chefs. Started as a 1 star night, settled for 3."
171151,"Drinks that glow in the dark? Okay! Drinks that are served in beakers? Okay! Drinks that remind me of my childhood? Okay! This place deserves like 5/5 for display, plating, and style. I love how the feel seems so casual, but so lenient, and the menu is so fun. I can't get over the fact that their drinks were so creative!

I come here for happy hour and I am so excited! This location is NOT capitol hill. I think somewhere it says it is. It's more like downtown/east lake. Anyway, their happy hour menu sounds so appealing I had to come in!

Tater tots... the best thing ever, as a kid... or a grown up! I thing these tots are fresh, delicious and crunchy yum! I got their burger deal for 2 during HH with fries or tots. I think the burger was too small and not worth it. A little flimsy. Their other burgers looked bigger so I'd probably get that. This one was just small. 

Ah otherwise, their mac and cheese is very cheese but very strong. The cheese tastes very mild and aged. Not my cup of tea. The chicken wonton hot wing thing was delicious. I loved the kick of spiciness and i love the aoili sauce. I could eat the aioli sauce with anything yumm!!!

Overall, I think the food was good, but not the best. I have to give it 4 stars for creative minds, great drinks, and great prices for HH. I definitely won't give up this place. Enjoy feeling like a kid even when you're not... don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Have a beaker of a drink :)"
903641,"I have been going to North Shore Hawaiian Barbecue for a few years now and always love it!  I can see why a lot of the reviewers here are giving it negative reviews -- if you like mainland-style fru-fru Hawaiian food, like the kind you get at places like Ohana, then you won't like this place. But if you like Hawaiian food like how the locals eat it, at least on Kauai, anyway, then this place is for you.

I usually order the chicken katsu or the chicken cutlet with gravy. My husband orders the spicy garlic chicken or the mochiko chicken. We also love the island fried saimin. Their spam musubis are awesome.

I'm from Kauai, born and raised. This food reminds me of how they make it back home."
827740,"I went here a few months ago with my Korean friend to eat here. They said it really wasn't too authentic, and was more geared towards Americans. We went in around 7PM, and there was only 1 other person eating there. I got the bulgolgi and my friend got the bibimbap with bulgolgi. My dish was actually barely warm, as if it had been cooked an hour earlier then served to me when I ordered it. By the time I was half done, it had gone cold. 
My Korean friend said she wouldn't come back because the food wasn't particularly good or memorable, not authentic, and even if she was in the area, she wouldn't bother dropping by again."
1177588,"Although it's a chain, this place is very consistent. Their bean sprouts are never brown, they're always fresh and the same goes for the broth. I highly recommend this restaurant as you can always except exceptional pho."
2163651,"Very yummy food! I had the bun, vermiccelli noodles with chicken and my friends enjoyed the food as well. We likes the fresh rolls! Great for small groups and families.
Affordable prices too! Small but clean."
803028,"Although the food and the experience was fun, watch your check and your ordering. I ordered Korean barbecue K2 and they charged for two people even ordering the spicy chicken too.. So two people got charged for three meals...an extra 30 dollars."
1503735,"I came here initially intending to use a Groupon and forgot to use it, so I returned a second time to make use of it.

My opinion both times was ""Meh."" 

Few vegetarian options. The salmon sandwich was all right, I guess. SO was equally ""meh"" on the chicken dishes. Everything felt really heavy and greasy and not in a good, satisfying way. The server on our first visit was very impatient and I felt pressured and anxious. On our second visit, service was okay but we were often ignored for extended periods. I gave up on ordering more beer.

It does feel like an English pub, I s'pose. It feels like a good place for a large group of people who enjoy sportsball."
2142049,Delicious burgers and excellent service with a smile. This is what America is supposed to be folks.
834407,"What a charming restaurant!  And we could mix Hawaiian (Spam Misubi), Japanese (Miso soup), and Korean (Bulgogi) in one meal.  Delicious food, large servings, inexpensive.  And the servers were very nice.  We will be back."
1068000,"Fun little spot.  Cute little local diner.  Decor is fun, kind of like the magical mystery van and the magic school-bus being driven by Tom Waits collided in a kids room.  Food is good, skillet orders are served right in the cast iron skillet they're prepped in, although they are a little heavy on the mass cooked under-seasoned potatoes there is a good selection of homemade hot-sauce to give them good flavor.  Their breakfast burrito is huge...looks like a great hangover cure.  Only one chef so it's a little slow and things like the potatoes are not cooked to order; this seems to be a point of extreme pride for them as they'll gladly beat you over the head with this fact printed on almost everything they own, used as an excuse and a snarky homely draw in conjunction.  Small kitchen so GF and the allergy heavy should probably avoid.  Generally fits the greasy spoon set up, but they've got Kambucha for all the hipsters to enjoy.  Awesome locally roasted coffee.

 Good little spot to try.   I look forward to trying their epic looking mimosas."
2122058,"I love Lola. The food is always really well-done and solid, and I like the upscale take on Greek. 

The atmosphere is great - especially for a 'nicer' meal with out-of-town guests or for business meals.Strangely enough, the best service and server experiences I've had in town have been here. 

I recommend the skewers (although it feels like the two are not enough for dinner sometimes. I wish the restaurant would add another), the lamb burger, *all* of the spreads (alhtough the kopanisti is mind-blowing) and the donuts. The breakfast here is also always great - another suggestion for out-of-town guests."
1093236,"I tried the Warthog today based upon Yelp reviews, while the customer service was good and the atmosphere was good for a sunny afternoon the food was not what I expected.  The chicken and pulled pork was dry and everything was drenched in sauce.  A good BBQ won't require sauce however, I'm accustomed to adding sauce as I desire.  More than likely I won't eat here again."
1079722,"Great gluten free pizza! didn't burn curs, good service!"
165923,"We ordered the calamari, mushroom cavatelli, sausage rigatoni, and tiramisu. The pastas were tasty, but the calamari was the best: fresh, lightly battered, nicely seasoned and flavored. The tiramsu was also very good, with nice rich marscapone.

An oddity - we were Asian, and were seated in the corner right next to the only other Asian customers in the restaurant. Everyone else was seated in the front next to the window. I'm not sure if it was a coincidence, but service was fine."
2759508,"Pretty good, but not excellent"
888824,"Mix between Chinese and Japanese food. Wish they would just stick with one and do it well or at least decent. I went there when it first open, it was OK then. Just went recently on a team lunch and I will never go back. The food has gone down hill."
803278,"Ended a 10-day vacation with an anniversary dinner here, and it more than lived up to our expectations. From exemplary service from our waiter, who provided great conversation, recommendations and history, to the delicious food and the spectacular view and private corner table, we could not have asked for much more.

We tried the steak tartare and the hamachi, the pork belly and the Canlis salad -- all terrific. They also gave us a plate of prawns on the house, since we couldn't fit it into our four-course menus. Then we shared the Muscovy Duck, which may have been the best entree I've eaten anywhere.

The dessert finished off the night nicely -- we had a special chocolate souffle with ice cream. 

All-in-all, it was a Top Three meal in my lifetime, which has included a number of delicious spots. I'd love to go back again -- despite the hefty price tag."
1741529,"My friend's and I had dinner here a few days ago after a long shopping trip at the mall. This was originally not our first choice to stop, we went to BJ's next door but the wait was going to be longer than what we were willing to do so we wandered over to Racha because there was no wait (Here's your sign!). We were told to wait to be seated even though the restaurant was close to dead on a Saturday night I may add. About 10 minutes later we were seated and  a little bit in to sitting down our waiter came by for our drink orders. I asked if they still honored Passport Corporate (a discount). After asking the waiter what the strongest drink on the menu was I ordered a Strawberry Mai Tai because that is what he swore would do the trick. Absolutely not, it was a sweet watered down mess. I ordered Massaman Curry which is my absolute favorite Thai dish. Out of all the places that I have gone I have never had Massaman that I did not like at all. We eat our food and our waiter never checks on us once. So we go to pay and he never comes back so we get up and go to the front to pay. We wait up at the front register for about 15 minutes when he finally comes to get my credit card. 5ish minutes later he comes back to ask if I wanted to use the Passport discount (it is printed on my credit card and the establishment is supposed to automatically honor it with no questions asked not to mention when I was seated I asked, so common sense tells you yes I would like to get the discount). After basically telling him DUH! He goes away and comes back 10 minutes later after charging my card 2 times instead of once because he did not know how to do the discount. The Passport Discount was buy one entree get one free but they put the stipulation of mandatory 18% tip so I only got like $2 off what the original total was without the ""discount"". I told her to reverse that transaction because after the horrible service and mediocre food I did not want to tip so I'd rather not get the $2 off and have the choice to not tip. A tip is when you feel that they deserve it and in no way does the cook, the waiter or the bartender deserve more than minimum wage. I was charge 3 times on one card and once on the final card that I paid with! My friend was charged 2 times on his card. Stealing from your customers is not the way to build business. 
We will NOT be returning to this one or any of the other chains they have."
823012,"Don't miss this great little sandwich shop.  The owner is amazing - great humour!  He'll give you a sample if you ask so you can be sure the flavour is what you're looking for.

Go traditional but I suggest that you share - the sandwich is HUGE!

Small spot but big flavour and personality!"
939522,"Food ranged from good to generally OK. The mussels were nice and the app portion was huge. The clam chowder was fine, not spectacular, but it was OK. It did have nice smoky flavor. The scallops were fried in panko, which I didn't really dig. The leek/bacon sauce was quite sweet, which I also didn't dig. 

Get a table with view. Overlooks a park, water and hills in the background. 

Service was prompt, friendly and overall, good. 

3.5 if I could."
945748,"The girls that worked here were so nice and helpful.  I was just a little indecisive and so wanted my mind to be made up for me.  I was recommended a sandwich with grainy brown mustard (I think it was turkey) and a cup of the chowder.  Both were delicious, the sandwich was slightly on the tangy side, but even so the flavors were spectacular.
The chowder?  Um amazing.  If I lived in Seattle, I would eat here at least once a week."
803664,"This is a pretty cool bar/restaurant in capitol hill. It's hipster-ish (but not obnoxiously so), sort of trendy (also not obnoxious), and somewhat urban, all at the same time. They have things like mason jar / glass milk carton things for water, great presentation for their dishes, a wide selection of local microbrews, and some odd decor. It felt very casual but also nice at the same time. 

They make amazing grass fed burgers! Juicy and flavorful and perfectly cooked. 
Salads were fresh. 
The garlic fries were very garlic-y, but not too greasy. 
The espresso chocolate milkshake was divine. 
Food portions are a liiiiittle on the small side, so maybe order a side. 
Service was very attentive and friendly. 
Prices were very reasonable considering the local ingredients and grass-fed beef ($7 salads, $8-9 sliders, $8-15 burgers). They also have, uh, less common meats like ostrich and rabbit. 
For how busy they were, they didn't miss a beat in speed or service."
903165,I had one of the worst crawfish eating experience last night. We went to The Cajun Crawfish on MLK last night and was told that they ran out of Fresh/LIVE crawfish. I like how they had the decency to inform us that they didn't have any more LIVE crawfish. To my disappointment I called Crawfish King and asked if they had any Fresh Crawfish. I was told yes so me and my group went to Crawfish King. After getting our crawfish and started eating we all could tell that the crawfish was chewy and tasted funny. I then asked the server if this was Fresh/LIVE crawfish and was told they are Fresh but we didn't get them delivered live. So meaning the placed that they ordered from cooked the crawfish and sent it to them. I don't know about you but having something cooked and delivered to you which takes a day or so and having it in the kitchen ready to be reheated with the house sauce is NOT FRESH and should not be considered FRESH. To top it all off they still charge us $12.99 for it while other crawfish houses sell their precooked crawfish at $5.99. Crawfish KING?...I think not...more like Crawfish Jester. So I probably will never go back to Crawfish King ever again unless it's to visit my friend Vhee and to only drink! Haha...!
267885,The food was amazing. The fried fish with spaghetti was not greasy at all.
944670,"The goat is slap your mama good. Damn! Comfy amount of heat, but I got a Pike Tripel to cool me down. Life on the patio is splendid. Will be coming back. You won't be taking home any left overs on these portions, but that's OK cause they're not gouging prices and the beer is reasonably priced too."
1950513,"Passing by the corner of Beecher's all the time and seeing a big tub of liquid-like cheese, we were intrigued because this place had the ""World's Best Mac N Cheese"". Apparently, this restaurant was featured on Oprah! We were able to grab seats on these milk cartons where we could peer at the process of how cheese is made.

Don't get me wrong, I love Mac N Cheese, and don't even get me started on how much I love cheese, but I didn't think this lived up to the hype of being the best in the world. It's definitely worth trying though! I wish I got to try their grilled cheese sandwiches. Looks yummy!"
2122904,"Ok so I am Japanese and lived there all my life. In Japan this place would be a 1 star in general but because Kukai have the chicken Kara-age-don that's pretty home style and some times good sometimes the rice is too mushy and this is America so I gave it a 3 star. 

All their Ramen stuff is pretty blah but passable. Also I recommend you get hot water soup on the side because it's too salty but if you have them add it in the kitchen it they make it too warm. At least it's not total garbage ramen like at Samurai Ramen. But I lowered my review to 2 from 3 now cuz they made me wait for ever for the check since the floor crew are just a bunch of amateurs. 

If you have never been to Japan and love Kukai I then highly recommend that you do your research on some of the Ramen shops in Japan that have won Ramen tournaments or just famous in general and get your mind BLOWN!!!"
952937,"I've been to Lecosho many times and I'm actually going tonight, which inspired me to finally write a review. 

Late night: Lecosho has become my go-to place ever since it was recommended to me and a friend for late night dining by a group of people at the Pike Brewing Company (as their kitchen closed for the night). That night, we ate off of the late night menu. My friend and I both had the burger with bacon. I've eaten a lot of burgers and this was one of the top 5 I've ever had anywhere, even better than the amazingness that is Luncbox Laboratory. I had a great local red, though I sadly can't remember what it was...maybe a syrah.

Happy Hour: One payday, I went to Lecosho for happy hour with a small group of friends. We ordered one or two of everything on the happy hour menu and shared everything. The sausage and spaetzle were delicious, but the sardine tartine was the most memorable. I absolutely love sardines (at a good restaurant) and always order them when I see them on a menu. We ordered plenty of cava, as well. I found the prices really reasonable as far as the drinks were concerned.

Dinner: I most often go to Lecosho for dinner, though I've never actually ordered an entree, which I plan to do tonight. I usually do drinks and appetizers, as well as dessert. They have some pretty life-changing desserts. I'm excited to try the porchetta tonight with a glass of wine.

Lecosho's food is delicious, their drinks are amazing and the service is absolutely awesome. The bartenders and servers are fantastic--not overbearing, but attentive, passionate about their food and drinks and always willing to whip up something really creative drink-wise (that isn't on their menu). I almost always go with a friend that won't drink anything unless it's sweet and they find a way to make her something that satisfies that craving while still being a tasteful cocktail, not a sugary mess.

As much as I love Lecosho and consider it a go-to spot, not only for happy hour/dinner after work, but for late-night dining when I can't think of another comparably delicious place that's still serving good food that late, I don't think it's quite on the level of some other spots (The Walrus and the Carpenter, Joule, How to Cook a Wolf, even Serious Pie). It's a place I love to go with local friends, but probably wouldn't bring out-of-town guests here simply because there are so many great options in Seattle.

I definitely give this place 5 stars when it comes to late night dining, though."
1941533,"Hungry downtown and had family in town. Came across Sullivan's and was not disappointed!

Started with the Shanghai Calamari, which is perfectly sweet and spicy. Should've ordered two! The Steakhouse Salad surprised me: I expected all greens and bits of steak. The salad came with decent sized steak medallions on a bed of spinach. I also picked off of my uncle's skillet mushrooms, which were amazing.

Our waitress was awesome, great to hold conversations with and attentive without being bothersome. The GM found out it was my aunt's friend birthday, so they brought out a warm wild berry crumble with a candle, singing and all. The crumble was delightful, and the staff came around and took a photo of the table. Before we left, they presented us with a card, black and white, with our photo inside and the signatures of the entire staff!

Definitely will return here!"
873676,"Ok sushi, SLOW service, but maybe they were busier than normal. The 45th St roll was our fave, followed by the for whom the bell rolls."
1258908,Wow. So happy to have found this gem in Washougal. Excellent  flavored foods with great service. We started with their soup of the day which was a Chanterelle Leek soup. It was beyond amazing! We also ordered the Margherita pizza and the sauce was terrific and it wasn't overloaded with cheese. Just the perfect amount of everything my daughter ordered some of their homemade ice cream and they actually brought out enough for the three of us to share. Awesome! What more could you ask for? Can't wait to come back!
873284,Food was good. Service not so much. Prices are a bit high for date night.
1444737,"DECENT FOOD. OVERPRICED. POOR SERVICE.

I really enjoyed my Crazy Jamaican Burger. The flavors and the texture of the tofu was pretty amazing. What was NOT amazing was paying $13.99 for it. My friend ordered the Jamaican TLT with an agave lemonade to drink. I was shocked to see on the bill that the lemondade was $7.99! LEMONADE!!! I mean damn, it was good, but not THAT good. A drink for that price better have some top shelf hooch in it and get me twisted.

The service was sub par. For the prices they charge, I expected better. It was obvious that the server didn't care to be there. Once my friend and I were finished eating, we sat to chat for a bit and the cook made a point to come out of the kitchen to stare us down and turn the music way up to the point that we could'nt hear each other, hinting that it was time for us to leave. Seeing as though we were the only patrons, we took the hint. 

I was pretty disappointed with the experience which is a shame because the food is good! I don't think I'll be going there again."
1329288,Definitely make a reservation. They have one bartender so it can be slow but the drink and the atmosphere make up for it! I had their french kiss and violet? Drinks and they were both good. I've been into sparkling wine so it was perfect!
1879384,"Okay, I am working with a salesman that has not been working hard enough. Do I cut corners on cost, set an example to my subordinate and go to a burger joint?

 No! 
Lunch is too important a meal to me because after all  it is one of the three most important meals of the day! 
My body also likes to be indulged with its cravings for the good stuff. Moose Creek BBQ on Yelp offers 4 stars which tells me its a definite go to stop! I consider myself a connoisseur of tasty slow cooked meats and decided this was our lunch destination. 
In a small corner space in a strip mall setting right next to Starbucks, just a door or two over, we walked up to the order desk in order to read a large handwritten menu of tasty slow cooked offerings. From a brisket sandwich, pulled pork, pork ribs and hot links, to sides of mac salad and baked beans. All had one thing in common, made here or smoked here and sounded really good! Soft drinks were offered by the bottle in the cooler and there was also a limited wine and beer selection that included one of my favorite beers that was appropriate for this establishment, Moose drool!

 I noted that offering to self for a dinner time or weekend visit some other day. After each of us ordered brisket sandwiches and a single side. ($11.95) we sat at one of the nearby tables lining the window and waited only a few minutes before our plates were delivered. 
My fresh baked sub style bread was cut in half & contained two generous slabs of lean, thick cut tender beef brisket with a perfect edge of bark and slathered in the house signature red sauce. Also delivered to the table were bottles of the same sauce plus a bonus!     ""Fire in the hole""       A heat packing BBQ sauce that placated my addiction to smoky heat, I ignored the XXXX warning on the bottle about thermonuclear hazards, dangers to unborn children and squeezed a generous portion to both sandwich halves, indulging myself to a magnificent  sandwich sided with  a cup of baked beans and a diet coke. Yes, as advertised Moose Creek BBQ is genuine & delicious. Prices are on the high side for a casual dining restaurant but the old adage of getting what you pay for is demonstrated here. We have a little bit of Texas in the NW! 
Next visit I do have to try a rack of those ribs and I will also plan on napping off my gluttony after my feast!"
1350480,"I've been a fan of any bar Gregg's involved with for several years now, and this is the latest and greatest. The drinks are top-notch and rival those of any other great cocktail joint in Seattle (Zig Zag, Canon, Tavern Law, Rob Roy and so on), and they're offered up uniquely in a southern-themed environment that's pulled off in manner that carefully toes the line of being both playful and mature. 

My standard drinks here are the Soul Tonic (a tasty take on a gin and tonic) and the Son of a Preacher Man (bourbon, tea, lemon, honey). Of course, you can always go off menu and trust one of their expert mixologists to change things up a bit (Nicci makes a mean Trinidad Sour). If you're looking to dine as well, look no further than the Shrimp and Grits. Or the Pork Sliders. Or the Pork Cheek Stew. 

I've yet to attend a sermon (Saturdays @ 10), but hear they're great."
822803,"If there's any go-to Italian restaurant in Bellingham, it's Mambo Italiano. 

The food here is divine and most definitely hits the spot! My favorite dish is the Primavera but I also love the pizzas & other pasta dishes. Their fried oysters look pretty good as well.

My only complaint is that there are so many flies buzzing about in the summer. Both big and small. They're EVERYWHERE as the door is kept open at times. Not the most pleasant guests to dine with.

The pricing isn't too bad, considering the quality of the food (which is amazing)."
1162380,"I'm almost hesitant to yelp about this hidden gem, just so I can keep it hidden. My selfishness aside, it's [hands down] our favorite breakfast spot. From their organic coffee, homemade feel & generous portions.. What's not to love!? Not to mention.. The food is DELICIOUS!! I'll be posting photos from this mornings feast :)."
2153939,Great atmosphere. And service was great. Love the variety in sushi rolls. We did do the chef special on the sashimi and it wasn't as fresh as it seemed. But it was very good. Very nice place for a date or nite out with friends. Definitely make reservations.
861810,So incredibly delicious and messy that you can ruin a $50 shirt and really not care. I wore my stained shirt like a proud medallion of the best sandwhich I ever had. The Carribean Roast.
834228,"We came here for our special anniversary and found the place was very nicely decorated and has a beautiful view of the puget sound. We go for the Rodizio (buffet style) and found the concept very interesting. The El Gaucho came to your table to serve you the unlimited meat choices. We ended the meal with a Pave De Maracuja, my wife doesn't quite like it, but for me, it's a mixed feeling, so no comments on that. Great atmosphere and very staff."
891640,"I absolutely LOVE Grinders. The owners Mitch & Denise are wonderful people that treat every customer like a guest. The food is very generous hand made & delicious.
I don't know if I could pick a favorite because everything we try is the BEST. I really appreciate the great music Mitch brings in on Saturday nights.
This is truly a one of a kind place"
2148972,"We had to try it as it is ""seattle's iconic burger joint"" and is so Seattle.
Cash only - we were scrounging up change but luckily had enough as it is cheap
Of 4 customers 2 were homeless
No customizing must order as is stated, not even plain for kids!
Somewhat surly employees
Walk up- no seating (prepare to stand or eat in your car)
Small menu 
Inexpensive 
Probably unhealthy
Good for burgers and fries
Surprisingly good!!"
1194126,"Good food but awful atmosphere uncomfortable chairs,tiny tables.
There was at least 5 larger tables open They Sat us at a small table with 2 other people on top of us. We got to hear about every boy they have dated. Won't go back ...."
1449064,"Came in here on a Sunday for a good beer and to watch football. The service was great, had really good music, good atmosphere, and GREAT beers and a lot of them."
1746871,"The entree was amazing.   I had the elk duet and my husband had the lamb, and both were spot on.  The parsnip brulee accompanying the elk was perfect.  The dessert,  however, was a disaster.  We ordered the berry crisp,  and it was anything but crispn. It was thin, tough, and chewy.  I couldn't get past the first bite.  The cappuccino had grounds in it.  We had the bread pudding on a previous visit, and quite enjoyed it, so ths was extra disappointing.  Our server must have known it was bad, because after being attentive during the appetizer and entree,  quite ignored us after serving the dessert, and never once asked how it was.  We may come back for a meal, but will have our dessert and coffee elsewhere."
2633940,"5 stars without hesitation.  We've lived in the neighborhood for two years and ate there tonight for the first time.  Man, are we kicking ourselves for waiting so long to discover this little gem of a restaurant!  

Started off with a cup of borscht - absolutely delicious.  Homemade, savory, nicely spiced with a dollop of sour cream ... what's not to love?

Our two main dishes were equally yummy.  The chicken with walnuts and pomegranates was great - chicken done to perfection, sauce not too spicy and delicious.  The lamb kebab was the best I've ever eaten.  Accompanying both was an ample serving of saffron rice with some roasted vegetables.  

I wish this little place were not stuck in the tired little Firdale Square but, once you know it's there, you drive there.  I wish them years of successful business and we'll sure do our part to keep them cooking!"
1651410,"I heard really great things about this bakery and I was looking forward to coming here. However, I was extremely disappointed in the customer service. Nobody who works here greeted us or was especially friendly. I ordered a sandwich, which was great, but it sat in the counter for ten minutes until I got tired of waiting and got it myself. They gave us a number for the table but did not seem to care that I was sitting there ready to eat.

The food was very tasty but I won't be going back because of the staff."
1901951,"We were so excited about this place opening and had high hopes based on our experience with the Queen Anne location on many occasions (as well as general dissatisfaction with suburban eats). But this place is just disappointing. Dis.Ap.Point.Ing. While the food was fine, and we'd likely give them another chance based on that alone, the service was absolutely awful. Luckily we didn't have a time constraint, it took an hour and a half due to the lack of service as well as the incompetence of the staff. We were fine with the wait, not the waiter's fault if they're understaffed, but after an already long wait and serving only half of our order our waiter asked if we needed anything else...?  Um, yes... The rest of our order please. His response? The kitchen is backed up. Hmmmm that's strange because people ordering the same dish after us already got their food.  We'd give kudos for admitting a mistake, or even if he just apologized.  Sadly it will be a loooong time before we try this place again."
886331,A bit disappointed for my first time. Appetizers came after dinner served and the fish was a bit shy on the rainbow roll.
810267,"The food is decent to mediocre but the service is nothing short of stunning...ly bad. 
With 45 minutes before our movie, we thought this would be a great place to grab a quick bite to eat. I mean ""Rocket"" is in their name, right? Even though I was one of maybe five other customers, I had to almost fight to get the attention of someone to place a togo order. I then waited close to a half hour for a couple burgers and some fries. This left us with just a few minutes to scarf down our food and rush into our screening. 
Thinking this had to be an anomaly, we tried again in a similar scenario. They got us again with their impressive dedication to poor service.
I'll never be back."
1968559,"Fast service, great prices, and the best gyros on the Eastside, hands down. Have been here several times, and will continue to come back. 

Don't forget to bring cash!! They don't take cards."
612786,Highly recommended for a solid seafood dining experience on the water. Food and drinks were solid. Very good service. And it won't break the bank.
1441336,I have no idea why this place has gotten so many stellar reviews - it is just a so so coffee shop. The coffee taste like something you made in your kitchen - nothing special. The prices are ok - pretty standard for a Starbucks or something. There are only 5 food items on the menu and all the sandwiches are premade - so no changing anything. I didnt want cheese and they said sorry not possible. Really? An $8 bagel sandwich and it is premade? Weak. The sandwich is good and the fruit parfait is big but all sugar so not healed at all - it is tasty but overall i was very unimpressed - this place def does not deserve high reviews. Come here if you just want coffee and a quick snack - not if you want breakfast!
891253,"Great burgers, fries and shakes. Cash or check only!"
821490,"Food was very good, the service was fine, atmosphere great, and the live music reminded me of being in a elevator.  We would happily go back however."
1154307,Had the fresh rolls and the pho ga. The fresh rolls could have been fresher and the large pho had like 3 slivers of chicken and not much for noodles. It was cheap $6 for the pho and $3 for the rolls but I wont be back.
811527,"We saw Dinner at Wotan's last week - I've heard their other shows are better and, while I haven't seen them, I have to agree all I can muster up for this show is, ""It was okay."" The performers do well with what they're given, but it was a pretty ho-hum story line. The singing and acrobats are impressive (and even more acrobats would be appreciated), but without something more interesting to tie it all together, it was a very long three hours. 
The food wasn't anything special and we left starving.
We got our tickets through Groupon at a discount, and it was still way overpriced. Around $50 a ticket, I would recommend this place, but not for $80 and up. If I see a discount to another one of their shows, I might go, but...probably not."
1899441,"This is such a charming little spot! Blink and you would miss it driving down the street.  Well worth the search.  All of the food is scratch made and the menu items are very inventive - this is not your typical breakfast spot.

I had the Southern Style Grits entree...oven baked home fries and crispy pancetta over the most creamy and delicious grits I have ever eaten!! Then they topped it off with a custard egg and parmesan cheese.  Yes, it was AMAZING!!  Mu husband ordered the stuffed french toast with toasted pecans and a scoop of vanilla gelato on top...CRAZY GOOD!!!"
2754286,"Worth waiting in the line, amazing food!"
1769912,"Our new go-to place for takeout, of any kind. Haven't had a bad meal yet, especially love the curries and the cherry naan my kids think is out of this world.
Portions seem larger than other Indian or Thai places we eat as well.
Always friendly too, my wife does most of our takeout and she always comments on that.
Only downside is the wait on takeout is sometimes a little long, but we will take that when the food is so good!"
955307,"Quick Summary: I found this place the summer of 2012 becaues of a $15 for $30 Google Offer; it turned out to be one of the worst dinner experiences I ever had. I give a 1 star because the service was only 1 star; the food was a 3 star.  This is a personal review, so I decided to rate the place based on the service... sorry to owner of Ho Ho. 

Details: the hostess lady was very pushing. I don't remember her name, but she said she was from Hong-Kong. I went with my wife and my father and one 4 years old kid. I don't know what made her doing this: she kept trying to get us to order expensive dishes, like prawns, geoduck, etc... (I later found out the price).  Cut the long story short, we end up having so much food on the table and when the bill came with $110, I saw she added 18% gratuity. I got pissed and asked what the restaurant policy was; she said that was the policy of the Google Offer.  Then I got really pissed because I just happened to read the policy before I used the coupon, I pointed to her that the Google Offer policy 'suggested' we should tip based on the original bill. When I pointed that out, she didn't show any sign of surprise at all, but more like getting caught cheating and said she would make adjustment right away.  
Such dishonest endeavor made our family dinner experience so bad, that we cannot even remember if there were any foods we enjoyed at all."
1275285,"we live in bonney lake, and one evening decided to try the pad thai here. the service was lovely. the girl i interacted with was very sweet and understanding. i'm not a pad thai connoisseur, but this particular dish was strange and unlike any pad thai i have had before. colorless and extremely bland. i could not even stomach more than half. maybe the other dishes are good, but i would not recommend the pad thai."
1241571,"Sushi was very good. Price was good too. I would give it at least 4 stars, but the service only gets 2 so thats why 3 is the overall. Maybe our waitress was having a bad day but she was very slow and not very pleasant. Took a long time to order food, then our water glasses never got refilled. Had to flag her down for the check. I would totally understand if there were more than just 3 tables being served at the time. If I were ever in the neighborhood I may try it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way and make a special trip up there  I suggest one of the box's for lunch. It is a good variety and filling."
797508,"The drinks here are usually good, but I've had a couple that weren't consistent. I was here last weekend and had a Pink Lady that just tasted like straight-up booze. I get that I'm drinking booze, so that's kind of the point, but one orders a Pink Lady for the added benefit of sugar and egg white and sugar. I've enjoyed this drink here in the past, but this time it was pretty flavorless except for the booze.

At these prices, sub-par drinks aren't acceptable. Hopefully it was just an off night, but next time I'll probably skip Knee High in favor of somewhere like Sun Liquor or Canon."
874434,"I seriously didn't understand Thai food until I came here.  

Best Thai food I've ever had (obviously), and it's my go-to for anyone who wants Thai in the U District/Wallingford/Fremont area... or anywhere.  Ever.

It is a little pricier than an average hole-in-the-wall Thai place, and that's just fine for me.  The portions are large, so it makes for a second meal of leftovers, and it's worth it to avoid the greasy, wilted stuff served at lesser establishments."
1465904,"Don't come for the view. But stay for the food and casino club/neon lighting!

My first visit had highlights and lowlights, which is why I held off on reviewing. I had to re-visit for the highlights and report back!

The first time, I had an odd experience. The service was friendly, but all the food for my table came out wrong for us EXCEPT the custom chicken burger I made. 

This place has the best burger-building options around. You know why? 

$10.95 gets you unlimited toppings on the a chicken or beef burger PLUS two sides, that include a choice of their ridiculously good fries, baked beans, potato salad, coleslaw (still too leery to try the coleslaw after the first time I had it. I hope it was an off-day when I tried it).

Before your eyes get too big for your stomach, try to limit the toppings on the burger. I have heard that people try to order all the toppings, either on the burger or ordering them on the side. Don't be THAT guy/girl. This unlimited build-a-burger is for people to order what they like, not to make you the burger Scrooge.

I order a chicken burger on their soft, dense bakery bun with chicken, cheddar, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed onions, jalapenos, spinach, garlic aioli, tomato, and a FRIED EGG. 

I've never ever ever ever ever had this combination of things together before in my life, but I've ordered it 3x now and can't seem to get away from it. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, don't worry, they offer toppings like lettuce, different cheeses, pineapple, pepperocinis and much more. 

I really like this place a lot. Good service and strong drinks!"
1459645,"Food is great service is poor. I have been to many Pho Tai locations. This one is the worst. The employees ignore you and don't even smile. I have walked out after sitting down two times recently . Sit there for 5 minutes and they do not even make eye contact. They were not even busy today. Workers are in slow motion, and don't seem to care."
1851614,"While visiting Tacoma on a business trip I gave Dukes a try. The location on the water was nice. A lot of times places with great views have marginal food, but not the case here. 
  We were greeted by the hostess who was very nice. She seated us promptly. Our waitress also arrived promptly. She was very pleasant. Drinks came right away, so all in all the service was great.
  Started out with the award winning New England chowder. It was delicious. Thick texture, a bit of spice and plenty of clams. ( I recommend the small bowl as it's hearty) then for the main course I had the Dungeness crab un cakes. They come with roasted potatoes and a small salad. They were very very good. Also a nice portion size. Finally we split a butterfingers ice cream cake. Split it...it's huge, but all delicious. I was pleasantly surprised they had Tazo Zen green tea. My favorite.
  If you are visiting Tacoma Dukes is definitely worth the stop on all levels."
2162012,"I've eaten at several high end steak houses across the country and El Gaucho is definitely one of the top on my list.  The atmosphere and service definitely set this place apart from a lot of the other big chains (morton's, ruth chris, etc).  Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing, but El Gaucho has that good old boys feel that makes the dining experience fun.

It's definitely pricey, but you should know that coming in.  Can't wait to go back."
814960,"Just like the other reviewers has stated, the service is horrible.  Over 20 minutes to come to our table.  The food was ok, but nothing that would warrant such a wait."
1338025,"I LOVE this place. Off the beaten path from the main strip, a real delight to find such a refined neighborhood restaurant. 
For a sunday night, there was a exciting buzz in the restaurant. Great ambiance and design. My date and I decided to sit at the bar as a space opened up right when we arrived. We shared four courses and previewed some excellent wines. (The cab by the glass was awesome). The bartender was very thorough and on point. We shared 4 courses, and never once felt rushed. Each course was plated perfectly, and never delivered before the previous course was finished completely. We were able to take our time and enjoy each bite. 
Food Was EXCELLENT. We had the Baby Kale salad (super awesome), Truffle Pecorino sformato, Sweet potato gnocchi and duck leg. We also ended up getting a couple of small dessert...outstanding!
Definitely a great find!"
600400,Stopped in for quick bite on New Years with a couple of buddies. Like I said the last time I'm never disappointed when I  come here and I come here a lot. I ordered the cheeseburger and chicken tenders like I always do. I swear it gets better and better every time I come here. On my visit before this one I did something  a little different and ordered the pecan pie w/ice cream. It was absolutely scrumptious. The pecan pie was warm and it coupled with the ice cream just perfectly. If you go you have to order that or the chocolate cake with ice cream because it's very good as well. It's a good thing we came in on New Years because all 3 of us were given a $20 gift card for our next visit since we came in on New Years.I knew there was a reason I loved this place and I think I just found out.
1668456,"We ate here yesterday, after wanting to try it for several months, despite some negative reviews, we were very happy with the food and service. The decor was fine. We had: veg samosas, chana masala, aloo gobi, chicken vindaloo, raita, naan, and rice. Everything was very good. Delicious actually. The waitress asked us how spicy we wanted our dishes and we selected a variety. Mild is what you'd expect. Medium hot made me break out in a nice mild sweat. Perfect. I recommend this restaurant."
910622,"Stopped by here for lunch and it was closed!  Out of business.  I did like their menu, but the service at this location was always lacking.  No two experiences were the same and the hostess usually set the tone for trouble.  Inflexible about seating preferences, waiters who never come back, and food mix ups.  Last time we were there my meal was free because I ordered the Carmela's chicken  and it came with no chicken on it.   I still love that dish.   However, I hate to go eat somewhere and have to complain constantly through out the meal.   It was tedious to say the least.  They were lucky I came back, but now they are out of business.   I hope other restaurants take notice.  Drive home the customer service or you too will be out of business."
934066,"Ate here late one night after a baseball game and were happy to find that they had a late night happy hour. We got pepperoni pizza which was delicious! Came out hot and fresh with the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, & pepperoni. Even the crust was good! (I only eat good pizza crust) We then finished the evening with the brick oven chocolate chip cookie desert. It was outstanding!

Would definitely recommend this place & would definitely go back even if it wasn't happy hour."
1948238,"Pizza was legit. Crispy and doughy. Had the houser and the wild green salad. 

Several flat screens showing sports and fun music."
789094,"nothing special here. large pho is too small might as well just get the small pho all they seem to do is give you more broth.  Been here about 4 times and the portions don't change so it wasn't just a one time fluke.  Need to see difference small vs. large thanks.  Also, takes too long compared to other pho places I have been too."
2484176,"I absolutely love this place. I live in Seattle, but shop at Bellevue Square and The Bravern at least once or twice a month and I always end up coming here with friends. Out of all the restaurants in the shopping part (downtown if you will) of Bellevue this restaurant has to be one of the most dependable. I highly recommend this to anyone."
1834470,"I just went for beer so this is a beer only review. They had a great selection with lots of guest taps. Great atmosphere, great service and great beer selection.

I would definitely go back for a beer!"
2721008,So slow! Waited for 10mins without a cup of water before ordering. Only 2 waitresses worked here. tastes not bad but a little pricy compared with its rude service.
958382,"Fun place, consistent quality, good service. They are always busy but that's a testimonial to them in the first place."
1040698,"YUM!  Had a wonderful Special Pastrami sandwich today!!!!  It was ""De Best"" !!!"
666199,"Oh my, this place is good.  First off, they were more than accommodating for our ever-changing group of friends.  Service was fabulous, they're very knowledgeable about wines.  I had the beef carpaccio to start with and then the spaghetti and meatballs.  Probably the best meatballs I've had...ever.  Friends had the lasagne and chicken parm, which also looked amazing.  Overall it was a great evening and I will definitely dine here again."
1910696,"Tried them when we visited Seattle last week. We ordered a hummus sandwich and a Mediterranean sandwich, and both were just okay. I was very very hungry at that time, and at that level of hunger, usually anything vegetarian tastes terrific to me! Considering that, I would perhaps rate them at 2.5/5, but the fast and courteous service (and the fact that Yelp doesn't allow ratings in half-points) makes me bump the rating to 3/5."
1153095,Really love this place very good chai tea and coffee. Always come here to study or chilling with friend. Very clean and the restroom they are soooo clean ! Stuffs always nice here!
2158762,"Great pizzas potato, sausage, mushroom, and the special were all fantastic. Great service as well"
1942811,"Shawarma King Food is great. If you consider the price I can say so far it is the best restaurant that I found in Seattle, Specially for Kebabs. All of its foods are great but its Lamp Kebab is one of a kind, in one word excellent."
1964656,"Glo's is a great place to eat brunch - especially if you're REALLY hungry! 

My boyfriend and I were hungry after working out on a Sunday morning, so we decided to head over to Glo's for brunch. We ordered savory and sweet entrees - the Salmon Eggs Benedict and the Blueberry French Toast. Mmmm both were so good! My boyfriend and I BEASTED through both plates, and the waiters were impressed! The portions - especially the Eggs Benedict - are big, so taking home leftovers is common thing among customers.

I took off two stars because the wait can get ridiculously long. My boyfriend put his name down on the list, and was told that the wait would be around 20-30 minutes. We thought it was nice that the restaurant offered complimentary water and coffee for those waiting to be seated - it was pretty cold outside. There weren't that many people waiting outside, so my boyfriend and I thought we wouldn't have to wait too long. What we were told was a 20-30 minute wait...turned out to be a 1.5 hour wait! 

We found out that Glo's allows customers to call in and put their names down prior to arriving at the restaurant after an estimated time period...and they just so happened to call in and be seated before us. I'm not sure how I feel about this policy - it just didn't seem fair to those who waited outside in the cold. But I guess now I know better?"
1893158,"Presse is our go-to place for bistro lunches and dinners.
The bartender and hostess is always nice to us and the waitstaff, equally so- even when it's busy. Our favorite reasons to go is to watch soccer. It reminds me of being back in the 16th in Paris-- there's a nice community of people who come here from our neighborhood, and it feels like our really it's our neighborhood bistro. 
One of the best reasons to come here is quite simply for the reliably good food at great prices. Steak Frites , Croque-Monsieur and their seasonal tuna salad are the 3 things I usually choose from-and I'm never disappointed."
1937539,"Went last night for a good dinner after a fun family day of Santa and lights. We were quoted at a 15 minute wait. At an hour after our time the person behind us in line yelled at the manager and was seated before us. We were shocked that we had been so patient and the people who acted terribly were rewarded with a table. Another 15 minutes went by and we were finally given a seat (we passed 4 empty tables!). I asked to speak to the manager 3 times and finally Alex  came over and said he would rush our order. 30 minutes later we got our food. The food was good and our server was great but the actions of the manager really disappointed us. We ate our meals but our night was already ruined. I couldn't believe that even with our 2 year old hungry the manager Alex didn't even comp an appetizer. Long wait, passing us up for a table, asking multiple times for the manager and not even willing to offer even a certificate to come back are the reasons that we will look elsewhere next time when we are hungry and looking for a good meal."
234301,"I came here many time and all of them were for a very late night munch, or should I say early morning :)

I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me there, we just got out of a club and we were both starving!! so we ordered their Mongolian beef and some fried rice and it was SO delicious! 

It was Halloween night so we had to wait for a bit to get a table but compare to all the people who had waited with us outside we got in pretty fast!

It is definitely a great place with even better food, low prices and fast service!"
1444690,I love famous daves. They have great BBQ!
2130112,"Best restaurant in Seattle! Make sure you sit at the bar and order enough oysters to satisfy at least two walrus families. The things are so friggin good! Fried oysters were delicious as were the sardines and mussels. I was not impressed by the steak tartar, but it wasn't bad, just not as good as the previously mentioned masterpieces. Stick to the seafood and you will be blown away!"
1104902,"Meh, honestly my least favorite 24 hour diner. 
I've been twice, and the first time I was a biiiit intoxicated so this clouded my judgement. Let me tell you, if you're drunk, you'll enjoy it. But that's true about all cheap, late night food, I guess. 
The second time, I was in better condition to analyze it properly. 
The hollandaise is weird. It tastes like fake egg liquid with no lemony hint. Oddly enough, it kind of reminded me of the cheesy pretzel dip they give you with big pretzels at a cheap bowling alley. Weird.
The server wasn't very friendly.. and that's me being nice. 
In the end, the food is alright.. nothing special about it, but I can't think of specific things to call out as being particularly bad either. 
It's a cold feeling, dingy kind of place. And the people eating there were a bit shady. But it is a 24 hour diner, after all. 
I don't think I'll go there again, with favorable diners like Lost Lake and Beth's available to me."
821206,"I'm in the camp that says Firenze is way overpriced for mediocre food. I had the lobster pasta special - lobster was tough and rubbery, and the cost was $38!

There are many other and better Italian places out there - skip this one."
1503938,"This place is pretty expensive for Korean BBQ, but hey if you want Korean BBQ in downtown Seattle then you gotta pay the price.

With that being said, we ordered bulgogi, pork belly, and a side of veggies. This place is NOT all you can eat, however with those three dishes we were stuffed. All dishes seemed fresh. I have no complaints. 

You also get rice and side dishes. My favorite side dish was probably the kimchi. All of the side dishes were pretty normal for Korean BBQ like kimchi, mash potatoes, fish cake, etc.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how cold the place is! They do not turn on the heat I don't think or maybe the heater was broken!?

Also, the place was super busy and it took a while before we could order and get our food. Overall, i enjoyed the place and if you are hankering for Korean BBQ and far away from Federal Way, I would go here. 

Also note: They have a parking garage under the restaurant and it's free to park!"
1738594,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after reading the reviews and I was more than happy with the service and food. It's not the traditional mexican style restaraunt with bright colors, lots of decorations, and margaritas (no alcohol offered here) but I was extremely pleased with the food. It's more expensive than I'm used to - for mexican food, but the food deserved the price.

They cook the food in an open kitchen so you can see exactly what they're doing and what they're putting into the food.

My boyfriend has ordered the seafood burrito every time we've gone here (I am continually surprised at how much seafood is in the burrito - it's very impressive) and I always get the Mr. Smothered. Hands down best burritos I've ever had!"
975763,"I have been here at least five times. I try to like it because its so darn expensive. Everytime i have been there the service staff was extremely friendly but always had us waiting too long between everything. 

 The food is good. I can't complain. I haven't hated any of the food there. I just haven't fallen in love with any of it yet. When your bill is over $150 every time. I want to fall in love."
257657,"I've been reading about Lil Woody's for a while, so I was pumped when I finally stopped in. So the place was pretty sticky, and that usually freaks me out, but I decided to stay and order some food. 

The woman at the counter was friendly but not exactly helpful. She didn't explain what I should order and how...so I felt like i missed out on the experience. I wish I would have known how to create my burger for optimal taste! 

Here are the pluses though: The fries taste so close to in-n-out burger fries I was so happy. I overhead the same woman at the counter telling another customer that if you order the burger with the onion ring seasoning instead of the burger seasoning, the burgers taste more like in-n-out burgers. It was all a bit greasy for me, but I would try it again. 

The location is tricky to find when you're driving, but it's there so find a parking spot and walk over. 

All the other reviewers seem to love this place, so I'll try it again and hopefully add another star."
803899,"The food was great but service was terrible!, My waitress was bragging about doing things behind her bosses back.. I mean I didn't have a problem paying a dollar to sample a wine... 

The only draw back was the salad that was just disgusting and awful!  Other then that the food was great, The service just was awful and No one was there when we walked in, It took forever to get food.I honestly have had much better experience there then this time around, It was my birthday and instead of being a fantastic lunch it was Meh! 

I really hope they do something with the waitresses during lunch time cause I was super disappointed if it happens again I will speak to a manager cause that was just awful... Also i should add it wasn't busy at all, was basically dead.. so I have no idea why it took so long to get service..."
1895220,"Just got back from lunch here and I feel pretty good! I ordered the Buffalo Bomber sandwich and have to admit, the chickn tastes an awful lot like, well, chicken. The breading was tasty and the sauces were YUM - they must use Franks for the buffalo sauce, which is A-OK with me, I'd carry that stuff in my purse with me if it wasn't a weird thing to do. All in all, definitely a tasty, decently priced meal - Veggie Grill has been added to my workplace lunch rotation for sure. I ate every last bite - portions were good to feel full and not overstuffed.

why only 3 stars? 2 things.
1st - no diet coke. Hear me out before you say oh this place is 'healthy' 'all natural' 'good for you' blah blah - diet coke is not BAD for you. I stand by this. No calories, no sugar, perfectly acceptable alternative to water but with delightful bubbles. How can you hate that?? 

2nd - don't be fooled by thinking vegan = 'healthy'. I just checked their website - my meal today with the Buffalo Bomber sammie/ upgrade to sweetheart fries/ ranch dipping sauce? A staggering 1,110 calories BEFORE adding a drink. I had bottled rootbeer (see above: delightful bubbles) which adds at least another 150ish calories... so 1,260 for lunch today. Do you know what an average lunch at McDonalds clocks in at? 2 cheeseburgers, med fry, diet coke = 980 calories.

And just FYI - my order was smack in the middle for items on Veggie Grill menu. Thai salad ranged from 450-690 with or without wontons, sammies/ burgers range from 440-780. 

Blah blah healthy vegan fake meat vs mcd questionable 'meat' arguments aside - you're still going to be needing to hit the gym every morning before eating here. Which is fine - but don't assume differently."
2160039,"For Seattle this is good fried Chicken, If you from back East  or the South highly overrated,  it taste liked they didn't season   it good"
1944105,Excellent service and really fresh! Chefs were cutting a fresh salmon right in front of us. Great variety of rolls and also serve a few different items such as shui mai and mochi bites.
882847,"A most awesome experience! We got here at 1:30 pm on a Friday. Wanted the porchetta, but they already had run out.  ;-( But I had the muffa and my wife the meatball with peppers, onions with mozzarella. Mrs. Batali waited on us and was so nice and helpful. We managed to score one of the tables near the register. Bread was the best, fresh chewy crust. The muffa with the olive tapenade and salumi was best I've had since Italy. The meatballs were all pork and delicious in a great marinara. This an experience not to be missed if you are in Seattle!"
1640649,"Simply delicious burgers, all cooked Japanese Katsu style. Don't forget the fries with the Japanese influenced sauces."
1140488,"Like savory crepes? Eat here. I had the 65th swapping the mushrooms out for tomatoes. My husband had the bean and field roast wrap and loved it. This place has skyrocketed to a top favorite for us!

Relaxed atmosphere, super friendly service, and the most delicious crepe I have had in Seattle. And I have had a few good crepes in this town!

Disclaimer: after reading other reviews  and a few visits here I feel I should say that yes, it takes about 45-60 minutes to get your food. Not quite sure why it is this slow."
1283742,"Love the tot-chos!  Good food, friendly service and a better choice than Denny's for a late night meal or snack."
899340,"love love this place, this will be my 3rd time here and there food is good,"
775343,"The wait isn't worth it for brunch.  Next to 0 vegan options, but if you ask, they might try, depending on who you ask..."
835644,"You can't expect much from a Red Robin, right? 

Fair enough. 

So I went in with low expectations. They brought me the wrong bun and the wrong side with no apology. I said, ""It's okay, I'll just eat it."" Did they offer anything to make up for their mistakes? 

Nope.

Did they make a courtesy adjustment to the bill?

Nope. They charged me full price for every single thing!

So now when someone asks me, ""Hey, wanna go to Red Robin?"" I say ...

""Nope."""
789260,"Their other site is much better.   Chicken is still good, but they're not as organized.  On the day I was there, people were waiting excessively long around the ""pick up"" counter.  I got in at 11 and got the order 45 minutes later.  I was expecting to wait 30 minutes tops.

I thought I'd probably do better calling my order in next time, until some other guy came in.  His order could not be found initially.  I guess I'll scratch that idea.  My call in may be lost for a few minutes too.

The employees do scramble to make things better though.  To their credit, the employees really work towards customer satisfaction.  I guess I'll just keep going to their Seattle branch.  They're more on top of things and consistent."
1137010,"We have eaten at many Ruth's Chris locations over the years but Seattle stands out as the best. Our meal and service were perfect. Our server was top notch, mgmt checked in at our table for  a few laughs. And the bread pudding... To die for!"
1727556,Love their burgers. Love the unlimited fries. Sucks you pay a dollar more for onion rings but theyre not unlimited. I only got like 5 rings. The ranch is amazing. Service is good.
1958213,"I've eaten here for a few years now, not frequently but at least 4 times a year. I've never had a bad meal nor bad service. I've been part of a large breakfast group of 10 and dinner for two and every thing in between. We've had to wait for a table for maybe 10 minutes during a busy Friday dinner service, otherwise seating has been quick.
Last night was one of the best meals I've ever had- anywhere. Good enough to prompt me to write a Yelp review.  

We started out with cocktails - a pint of powerful margarita for hubby and a ""Hey Pretty"" for me - a surprising and refreshing cocktail, and an appetizer of Smoked Salmon Crouquettes that were to die for - fried up crispy and light. Hubby had the pork chop which was moist and tasty (I don't like pork chops but had a bite of his and it was good!) It came on a bed of roasted root vegetables which I tasted and again, I never eat beets, but these beets were good, as were the rest of the veggies I tried off his plate.  I had the Southern Pride Pasta with scratch made Andouille and chicken in a dijon sauce. I would've eaten all of it but I wanted to enjoy it for lunch today. All of these items are on the new fall 2012 menu.  We topped off our meal with bread pudding - I like bread pudding in general but this was over the top good. According to our attentive and friendly waiter, it is made with the biscuits that are left over from the morning, so it was fresh and light and oh so delicious. 

The Hi-Life remains my standby, good food restaurant. I am not into high-end, snobby cuisine. You won't find me at a restaurant where the least expensive entree is $20. When I go out for a meal I want to be relaxed and enjoy quality food and decent service. Meals should be more than just taking in fuel, and eating out even more so. At the Hi-Life I know I'll get quality food for my money. I have never been disappointed with a meal there."
1781772,"OK, this place has an amazing selection of beers, which is fine. But the service and food are both so-so. I love that they have Petrus on tap, which is one of my favorites. Good mix of beers  from near and far. They have ""Randalls"", which are some kind of beer-infusing devices that are filled with flavor-enhancing ingredients. The beer flows through this device and picks up the flavors of orange slices, cinnamon, candy canes, bacon, or whatever you want to put in there. It seems like they have a different one every day or so, and they're currently doing ""The 12 Randalls of Christmas.""

I tried a pretzel and one of their pizzas, both of which were mediocre. The pretzel had way, WAY too much butter/oil on the outside and is served with a ridiculously spicy, sinus-clearing mustard. I SWEAR TO GOD that it was actually just liquid yellow wasabi. And I LOVE spicy. But this was just too much.

The pizza I tried was pulled pork and kimchi. There were jalapeno slices on it as well, and maybe a dusting of some kind of cheese, but  not really any sauce. It was pretty unremarkable. They need to load up a little bit more on the toppings. 

We sat down at the bar on a not-very-busy Tuesday night and weren't acknowledged for almost 5 minutes, which is basically unacceptable. I mean, at least throw a ""Hey, welcome! Be right with you!"" in my direction. The bartenders were pretty antisocial. 

I might try The Pine Box again, and hopefully have a more positive and less ""meh"" experience."
692109,"I was told this is a must try joint for Texas style BBQ so I finally got around to giving it a whirl.  When I walked in I was a bit confused where I had to go to order because nobody was out front.  I saw someone peak through the kitchen window and walked around to help me finally.  The menu is posted on the wall on the left side of the restaurant.  I don't know if it is the handwriting or my inability to make a decision, but I had stare at the menu for a bit before I could make a decision.  I suggest looking at their online menu.

Ordered the BBQ ribs and pork sandwich during the noon hour.  The ribs weren't falling off the bone tender, but they weren't dry either so my feelings are mixed.  The BBQ sauce itself was legitimate -- good balance of sweet, tangy & savory. 

Sides I ordered: baked beans (OK), cole slaw (decent), macaroni and cheese (tasted like Velveeta to me -- sorry if I'm wrong!), and side salad (some of the lettuce was wilted).

For two meals and a couple extra sides, total was just less than $25 for lunch.  I might give it another shot down the road, but not in a rush to return anytime soon. 					Show owner comment »"
823682,"I was surprised. All the places to eat along the Kirkland waterfront that range from quick cash grabs to fun and diverse food. I kind of expected with this location (on the water, right by a park, minimal parking, seems like half the place was part of the bar, etc) that the sit-down service would be lacking.

We were wrong. I went with two other guys and we were both really impressed with the service as well as the quality of the food. I would like to go back to try other things on the menu. Also the view was pretty great from all over the sit-down area. (Perhaps a bit bright at times, even fully overcast) 

My friends all enjoyed their food a lot and we were able to have a conversation. (IE: the room, while 50% occupied was not noisy. ) 

It's still got the Kirkland waterfront parking issues, but it's more out of the way from some of the other places you might tend to think about, so it might be easier to get into."
1345828,"I have been here twice and have so far very much enjoyed both experiences! If you are going at a popular dinner time make reservations or be ready for a wait! I was planning on meeting up to 6-7 friends on a Saturday night and decided to call ahead for a reservation and man did that pay off! The restaurant was packed and there was quickly becoming a line up of people waiting to get seated for dinner service. Since my party had a reservation not only did we get seated right away we got a private room in the back, which could get probably 10-12 people in there. we comfortably had 7. The service was a little slow but I can't blame them too much because our party trickled in and they were clearly in the middle of a busy dinner rush. The menu was GREAT! Vegetarian and Gluten free options, just ask. Cocktail selections and the food were all delicious! 

The other time I was in was a week day for lunch, they weren't too busy and me and my boyfriend were in and out with a quick lunch service and a lunch meal which is a little smaller and served with a side of rice and soup."
859791,"Not bad.  The bacon egg & beecher, and turkey, bacon and avocado are worth getting more than once.  Cute, marketplace atmosphere."
842205,"Perfect!
Great coffee.  Great atmosphere.  Great service.  Great breakfast.
You never know what to expect when travelling.  This place was as wonderful as any coffee house can be."
2131217,"CafÃ© Campagne is a true gem. Stop by and enjoy the delights of the French bistro one block from the historic Pike Place Market.  The space is cozy and inviting, the service is top-notch and the food is consistently delightful. I highly recommend the lamb burger but have yet to be disappointed with any of the menu choices. Be warned, you should come prepared to have a new favorite spot in downtown."
1125231,Solid fresh food. Good service.  We've been a few times and have been consistently satisfied.
209848,"I hate to see all the bad reviews Texas Roadhouse is getting.  All though from the crowd they have just about ALL the time, you wouldn't know that so many people don't like this place.  We've been a couple of time and have enjoyed our meal every time.  I ALWAYS order the Rib eye... My husband on the other hand... Likes to switch his order up.  This last time I... of course... had the Rib eye, and the hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak.  I hardly EVER order chicken fried steak out because in my search of chicken fried steak in just about the WHOLE state of Washington, I've never even found a decent chicken fried steak.  Being from Texas I pride myself on knowing a good chicken fried steak when I taste one.  LOL

So, when the waiter was back with our drinks we were both ready to order... mine... rib eye, hubby surprised me by ordering the chicken fried steak.  I gasped!  WHAT are you doing???  You KNOW that they don't have good chicken fried steak up here!!!  He said... you know... I have to give it a try.  So, he went out on a limb.

I got the usual sides for my steak, baked potato and salad with thousand island dressing.  Yeah, I know... you thought I was going to say ranch... didn't ya?  Hubby got mashed potato's and green beans.  Oh, and the hubby ordered a margarita with a shot of tequila on the side.  The margarita was good... not GREAT, but it was good.

So, while waiting on my salad and our meal we had some of their wonderful fresh rolls.  I have to be careful because I'll eat too many of them and not have room for my meal... so I limited myself to just ONE roll.  Now THAT'S what you call control.

A little bit later the waiter comes out with our meals.  Husband got what HE ordered... I on the other hand got a rib eye (check), baked potato with everything (check) and green beans.... WAIT A MINUTE!  I didn't order green beans.  I informed the waiter of this... he said he was sorry and would bring me my salad... I personally prefer my salad BEFORE my meal... so I said... No... that's ok, I'll try the green beans... maybe I'll like them.  First thing I always do is cut into my steak to see if it's cooked to my order.  It was... they usually do a good job on temperature.  The baked potato was good as well... I LOVE that they put salt on the outside of the potato.  As far as the green beans... well... I wish I would have gotten my salad.

NOW let's talk about the chicken fried steak... I was lucky that he hubby shares much better than I do.  He even asked me if I wanted to try it.  I was skeptical... but said... OK.  Thank goodness I tried it... BEST CHICKEN FRIED STEAK IN THE TRI-CITIES hands down!  I finally found a place that I will eat chicken fried steak.  I realize that there are Texas Roadhouse's in Texas... but in Texas... that is not the place to order chicken fried steak... there are MUCH better places to order it... but here... it is YUMMY!  Next time I'm at Texas Roadhouse... I'm going to order it.  No doubt.  I do have to mention this too though, I wasn't crazy about the cream gravy... it was a little on the sweet side to me.  So, I'd probably go for brown gravy ONE THE SIDE for mine.  But if you like chicken fried steak... this IS the place to get it.

I do also have to mention the service... this place IS lacking in service.  Drinks went try... wrong food brought out... so if you are ALL about service and not really about the food, I would say this place isn't for you.  Also the noise level in there is pretty high... not a place for a nice romantic dinner.

If you don't mind a noisy place... just acceptable service, but wonderful food... then I say High tail it down to Texas Roadhouse... you won't be disappointed.  =)"
791984,"Dick's is cheap, but you don't get much either.  The burgers are small, unexceptional griddle style burgers.  Bun to meat ratio way off.  No special orders. Soggy, bland fries.  

I like the idea of a drive in, but at this location there is no where to eat at all, so it's a to go place, or eat in your car.

Bottom line: Despite the cool throw back of a 1950s drive-in, a better burger experience can be had almost anywhere."
81874,"Came here on an early weekend morning when the other half was craving a croissant just like we had a short time ago in Paris. I have to admit, these came pretty close! I had a delicious cup of Chai tea with a buttery, light croissant. My only qualm was that the portion was very small for the price (only a few bites?). Even the pastries I had in Paris were much bigger, so no saying it's a ""we're fat Americans and that's how it is in Europe"" thing. 

I'll be back again on another quiet Sunday morning, I'm sure. Definitely the best time to go to avoid the line, which was building up quickly after we arrived."
1253554,"Anyone who thinks this place is expensive is crazy. Go with friends and share the pizza and try different kinds. It has a very modern feel to it and the television is projected so it isn't too distracting. The crust is soft and crispy on the edges. I had the meat pizza and the toppings were great and the crust was great, very good sauce as well."
1951859,"This is a nice, small, casual place to grab a bite to eat. Service was great; remember to bring some change for tip! You order and pay up front (not at your table), so there is not room to write any tip on your receipt. I ordered their Pesto Chicken Panini which was delicious and it came with potato chips."
240880,"Dang it Yelp!! You tricked me again. I thought with all of the stars for this restaurant that it would be worth while to check out. I was wrong.

Also, I figured since they allowed reservations that this would be more of an upscale place. It's nothing more than a mexican, sports bar.  I prefer the atmosphere more at the Matador compared to Laredo's.

I had their Al Pastor taco plate. It was good and I like the addition of zucchini and corn  as a side. My husband had their mariachi burrito but he wasn't wowed by it.

We won't be coming back. Queen Anne is a pain to drive to and park in. And the food wasn't that amazing. 
Sorry guys."
1842030,"I've had better pizza other places, and its very loud here as they crank up the Rock n Roll music- which I dont mind I just want to hear myself think lol, the food last time I went here was so-so, but I would disagree with Destiny in saying Dominos is better, from the last two experience I had between the two- The Rock wins hands down."
840897,"We originally came here today to visit the Kitchen Nightmares restaurant next door, but as it turns out, they are closed on Sundays (which seems strange given that Gordon has tongue-lashed previous owners for doing things like that).  New Mexicans BBQ is right next to it, and it looked good, so we decided to try it out.

We both really liked the sandwiches we got.  I had the pulled pork and the fiancÃ©e had the brisket.  Both had very tender, moist meat that was just amazingly good.  They smoke it right behind the building - the rear door was open this afternoon for lunch and the aromas coming from the smoker were just mesmerizing.  The jalapeno sauce complimented each dish very well.  Each sandwich comes with beans and while I thought the baked beans were good, they weren't out of this world like the meat was.

I liked the dÃ©cor - very unusual to see the types of knick knacks they had hanging on the walls in the Puget Sound region.  I would definitely come back here if I were craving a bbq sandwich and, say, I were going to Comcast Arena for an event."
1041039,"Delicious roasted cauliflowers, lamb and Turkish coffee ice cream. You may want to order more bread early..."
2675886,"I'm visiting here in Seattle from L.A. (Lower Alabama). Growing up in a Greek household and having been familiar with these dishes made me feel like I found my home away from home. I walked in, greeted, and told ""welcome to Plaka, you're family when you walk into this door."" Everyone was hospitable! 
     I ordered the Marithes- which are fried Pacific smelts with skordalia, for an appetizer. For my main dish I ordered the Paithaikia- it is 6 grilled lamb rib chops that is so succulent and tender! The lemon potatoes and fasolakia helped pull all the flavors together I was craving! Everything on the menu is incredible! I'm coming back Saturday to enjoy one last amazing meal and listen to some AWESOME LIVE GREEK MUSIC!"
814141,"Stopped in for a quick kids meal. Service was child friendly and quick. $5.50 for a bowl of pasta and a piece of a baguette. However, no drink included or anything activities to keep the kiddo occupied. The kids meal was brought out promptly and by the look of how much my son ate, it was tasty! On a negative note, being such a kid friendly mall, I was surprised to not see a change table in the restroom."
2154342,"GREAT SUSHI!

I've been to a lot of sushi places in Vancouver and Seattle and this place is by far one of the best! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is in the area.

They also have a killer happy hour! :)"
214995,"You know what? I really did need a burger! Thank you little shack in Fremont, you read my mind!

I have been a fan of this place for a very long time, and I think I've eaten here enough to write a good review! First off, you'll notice the menu is a good mix of traditional to the more inspired choices. Every burger I have had here has been top notch and perfectly cooked! The meat is consistently flavorful and the bun is always perfectly toasted.

You'll find your regular burger joint sides here, from omnom worthy fries to the mouthwatering onion rings, you can't go wrong! My only complaint is that I wasn't too keen on the poutines... I've had better and methinks that going to Skillet has spoiled me for every other spot that has poutines. Anyway.

The atmosphere is inviting and the servers are always super friendly. You order from the counter (a la fast food style) and take a seat. They do bring your order out to you and the cooks are fairly speedy with the prep/cooking.

Overall... I really don't have any complaints... aside from the poutine... but that's pretty minor...

overall... I'm a fan.

4 you-really-need-this-burger-inside-you-now stars out of 5"
946060,"If you are looking to stuff your face with cheap, over-seasoned  claim-jumper sized portion, don't come here!

Plaka serves some try amazing food. Try the Rabbit or the Goat, just delicious. 

The desserts, like the Quince or off-menu Ek Mek are to die for. 

Service is great, and you are treated like one of the family."
831392,"I had heard of this place from a friend and after seeing the great reviews, I decided to check it out. I got the carne asada fries because I've been craving them for a while - and i have to say, they were really good. I didn't expect such a great place since its kinda hidden. The best carne asada fries have to be when i lived in San Diego and I am so glad I found this place because now i dont have to wait til i visit San Diego to enjoy some good ones."
669673,"Highscore is a good little burger joint convenient to downtown Redmond.

Several things set it apart from all the other burger joints in the area; quality & price. There are a lot of other places that serve a bacon cheese burger in the $7 range, but none of them do it with a grass-fed, hand formed patty on a GLUTEN FREE bun, with smoked bacon and a choice of  5 cheeses! SHEEZE!  The accompaniments are delicious too, crisp pickles, tomatoes, lettuce and onions. 

I decided to try the seasoned fries and went with Cajun this time. They had a nice creole seasoning on them, but not too much as to overwhelm it. My friend got the Greek fries and they were sprinkled with rosemary. I think feta cheese and maybe diced garlic would take them from good to great.

Pro tip(s) Bring quarters to play the vintage video and pinball games and save room for the Full Tilt ice cream. It is not to be missed. The Vegan Blood Orange chocolate was outstanding!

Summer-time is going to be great out on the expansive patio with an ice cold Sierra Nevada!"
802012,"We had the Spring Roll, Pad Thai, and Thai Pork Fried Rice.  The food was very bland.  I would not go back."
2144194,Super good sandwiches. A definite must for anyone living in the seattle area
1771807,"very nice view. there's your second star. the booze are very over priced. very.  and I'm not a cheap ass. 

appetizers were tasty. 

our steak was very undercooked. I let it rest because I didn't want to send it back for the over cook. sent it back and voila. over cooked.  the table next to us. two send backs and the other was undercooked as I watched her cut in the middle but she ate it anyway.

513345,"Let's be honest. What Yelper is gonna pass up a little sassy joint called ""Biscuit Bitch""!?

We had a brief day and a half stay in Seattle at the end of our trip and I wanted to at least spend some time around Pike Place Market and be tourists. It was a typical damp and dark Seattle day and I wanted a nice little breakfast to start. I saw the Bitch on Yelp and I had to stop in. They're tucked inside the coffee shop, Cafe Lieto, but it appears they operate as one. We ordered some big ol' biscuts and coffee which came is some cute little mugs, everyone being different. (Mine featured a pig).

The service here is awesome. They were so friendly and conversational and wooed us with their love of biscuits. When our order came out, my tongue was on floor: Fresh, hot biscuits piled high with sausage gravy, shredded cheese, and bacon. This was no healthy meal but I put my inhibitions aside. The coffee wasn't bad either! 

So the Bitch was a hit and our stomachs were full. Really glad we stopped in here to smell the gravy. Definitely a hoot and I know I'll return when I'm back in Seattle."
1083632,"I don't know where to start! I received a gift card for my birthday and decided to go to brunch this morning with my friend and aunt. It's a very cozy atmosphere and I loved taking the time to look at all the decor. We didn't have a reservation, and even though they were busy, we were promptly seated in a cozy area. Overlooking the menu, we couldn't decide what to order it all looked so delicious. We ordered the Romeo and Juliet Tea which had a strong rose scent and taste. I, for one, love rose so I didn't mind it strong. Deciding to do a ""family style"" meal... we ordered 4 breakfast meals and decided to share them all. They were ALL delicious. The service was great. We had someone checking in on us often and I was able to use the Yelp deal of the day when paying for our bill. I will most definitely be back and we are excited to make brunch here a monthly ritual."
966116,"Ok.   Service was slow but suspect it was related to higher traffic than usual for a Wed night.

Food was generally good.  Gauchos were good with their frequency of stopping by.

Drink service was insanely slow; 20 minutes for a drink is really just not ok."
681556,"When Chinese people read good yelp review about Chinese food that is written by Americans, they usually will not trust the review.  The reason is that we eat differently even going to the same Chinese restaurant. But this place is the one of the place both Chinese and American will give good review.

It is one of my favorite Sichuanese restaurant to go to around the eastside. They are not traditional Sichuan food. But their food are simple, clean, cheap, big portion and good taste. It is family style spicy Chinese food, nothing fancy. The services is quick as well. I never tried the hot pot before there which I did not think they are as good as the other famous hot pot place."
1396441,"PROS:
-Weird atmosphere
-Killer amount of food
-Delicious bacon, not the stuff that places usually try to pass off as bacon, but real honest to goodness bacon
-This would be good food to eat while intoxicated or for a hangover

CONS:
-Abrupt, almost rude, service. However they are probably getting zero tips from the poor college students.
-The food, particularly the hash browns, is incredibly greasy. It was not good on my nice and sober stomach.

OVERALL:
If you are in college, if you are drunk, then go to Beth's and get large portions of greasy food.                     Show owner comment »"
35773,"Had the Mac n' Cheese, it was very flavorful but I was only able to finish half the bowl :("
984106,"For conver belt sushi I find they have the most varied selection,  and things always taste good. A little pricy but worth it their quality.  If you wanted real sushi go to a sushi joint,  for conver belt sushi,  Blue C works."
1667339,"I ordered On-tama Udon and Asparagus Tempura. The tempura was cold and not crispy (probably sat outside too long). The udon noodles and soup were good. The soup wasn't as hot as I would have liked. The noodles were fresh as we saw a chef making the noodles at the restaurant.

One friend ordered the curry udon and had probably less than half. She was very unhappy. I wouldn't have ordered it anyways since I'm not a fan of curry and udon as a combination. Another friend ordered the udon with tofu and he said the food wasn't that good either. 

Having eaten udon at Hawaii and in Japan, I can say those places definitely had much better. But considering this is Seattle and there aren't many other places that serve fresh udon, I'm not complaining too much. It seems pretty hard to mess it up."
2517701,"I hate to see such harsh reviews on this place . This is mine and my hubby's favorite date night locations!!!  Great atmosphere and the food is amazing. We have only had 1 item that we didn't like and that was a drink--- we try a new thing each time we go and are NEVER disappointed!  My only ""so-so"" comment would be it can get quite loud on game nights, because there is not a big separation from the restaurant seating and the bar area, so if you want a quite intimate setting, this probably wouldn't be the place for you."
1313281,"I had to break the 666 review mark!  Good brunch and I wished I had tried one of their boozy drinks they sounded tasty!  Their Good Glory Grits dish is the 2nd best I've had in Seattle.

The biscuits are huge and flaky and the eggs were seasoned just right.  My lady got the oatmeal which was overly sweet, as I tried it as well.  I guess some people might need their oatmeal that sweet but not us (hence 4 stars). I will come back for dinner and try out the fried chicken and Mac and cheese."
1109247,From walking in I felt totally like I was very welcome and they wanted everything to be perfect! I think this was the best meal of my life. Sadly I don't live in Seattle or I would be here a lot!
817706,"Note: The online menu is NOT an accurate representation of the menu they have at this Bellevue location. 

I came here for a private group dinner with friends and we were seated upstairs in the bar that overlooks everyone down below. Great for people watching, it's a nice, private area. Excellent for large get-togethers and when you'd like to have your own event. 

The sushi is okay. The fish is fresh, but I'd say it's fairly overpriced compared to sushi places in Seattle. However, I suppose you're also paying for the ambience and environment (this is downtown Bellevue after all) -- I guess just keep that in mind. 

I had the smoked salmon sashimi (YUM), california rolls, avocado + eel rolls, and octopus nigiri. I honestly prefer sashimi to all else, and if you're not well-versed in the world of sushi, feel free to pass up on anything with octopus or squid. The way they are prepared, it has very, very little flavor. Not worth it. They had a wide selection of other foods on their menu, but I left wanting just a little more. 

They also have a wide selection of drinks, although they pour a little too much ice. Hopefully you're not there to get drunk. I think as other people have mentioned, their prices are really high. I'm a little disappointed since there are better sushi places than this for a better price, but I suppose if you'd just like to stick around Bellevue, it's okay. I don't plan on going back. Sorry!"
937318,Great breakfast spot!
948507,"I took my girlfriend here for a special date night (we usually tend towards the cheaper date options).  It was awesome!  The show was excellent, thoroughly entertaining the entire time.  No matter where you sit, you'll be super close to the action because it's a fairly small space in which they operate.  The food was delicious.  My girlfriend has a lot of food allergies, but they were able to accommodate her & exceed both of our expectations.  Definitely recommend this place!"
1949774,"Excellent food and service. This is a must
for any foodie living in Seattle!"
891063,"I've been on the hunt for a sushi place that I consider a ""keeper"" ever since I moved here a few weeks ago. Well, I found it. I wandered in the other day while on my lunch break, and ended up seeing why the place has good reviews. I sat down and was immediately served a salad, which was absolutely delicious (not sure of the type of dressing. I need to ask). Then, a couple minute later, I was brought a nice bowl of Miso soup, that also ended up being spot on. I ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll, and the Green Lake Roll, and both of them satisfied this picky sushi eater. The Green Lake Roll was awesome. The asparagus really adds a nice touch. The sushi chef was friendly and willing to chat, and the service was prompt. So far, it's the best sushi I've found in Seattle."
2167587,"Meh. Nothing memorable, especially considering the prices. The chicken dish was good, but the waitress acted like it was an imposition to substitute vegetables on the side for just one of the all starch sides. 

Overall, the food is heavy and is covered  butter and oil.

The desserts were great though, especially the chocolate cake."
260271,"Just found our new weekend lunch spot!  

We were there after 1 p.m. on a Sunday.  We went after 1 p.m. since we wanted to eat off of the lunch menu (and not the brunch menu).  Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded.  Maybe the brunch crowd cleared?  After a few minutes wait, we snagged a booth.  

The decor is kind of a hip 50's diner?  Nice, casual atmosphere.  I had a pulled pork sandwich which was on soft, warmed, ciabatta buns.   It also came with small cups of cole slaw and beans.  I could snarf down a bowl of those beans.   This is definitely an ""elevated"" pulled pork sandwich.  If you are expecting a mound of meat, then this pulled pork sandwich may be a bit lacking.  For me, it was a perfect balance between the bread and the meat.  

My kid inhaled his kid's cheeseburger so it must have been good.  However, I note that there appears to be a difference in the ingredients  -- including meat --  between the kid's cheeseburger and the ""signature"" cheeseburger that my husband ordered.  (Some places, like Lunchbox Laboratory, the kid's cheeseburger is exactly the same as the regular cheeseburger other than that it is ""plain"" (i.e., does not come with lettuce, tomato, etc.)).   The kid's cheeseburger looked suspiciously ""pre-made,""  which was not the case for my husband's signature cheeseburger.  

There were lots of other yummy looking stuff I wanted to order, but will save it for next time.   

For a party of 3, it ended up being $54 (which included a glass of wine, 2 sodas and 1 kid's cheeseburger).  

No doubt about it, we will be back!"
285725,"Overall a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The food is basic American comfort food, but well-prepared, delicious and served quickly and hot.  What I like most about this place is the outdoor deck and amazing views of Lake Union.  When I want to relax, enjoy a really good meal and watch the sunset, this is the place!"
922078,"I've never been to Italy but DAMN, I felt like I was there when we sat down at Panevino. Not only was it crowded, it was loud as hell and the waitstaff was merrily contributing to the cacophony. 

We showed up in time for their late night happy hour which had plenty of enticing entrees to choose from.  I went with the Scampi Al Limone - huge shrimp on crostini and mixed greens - and it was the perfect light dinner I was seeking. We also split the mussels/clam in a spicy garlic sauce - DELISH. 

The house martini with vodka was tasty and not shy on the alcohol. 

Service was good for the most part - our server made a bit of an error with the appetizer and instead of apologizing, argued about with us about it. Kinda weird and the only drawback of this place. 

Definitely worth a comeback!"
1167504,"Mr Gyro is magical  The food is cheap, delicious, and plentiful-- two gyros, a side salad, and an order of fries feeds me, the husband, and the toddler with extra to spare.  While the space is... less than cozy, the guys working are always super friendly, cute, and serve me food quickly.  The gyros are awesome-- love the meal as well as the gyro plate (with hummus, salad, and rice).  I hate to say it, but they lose one star for not being open after 3pm on Saturday.  Other than that, they are my go-to for takeout and great service."
982068,"Came here today to watch the Super Bowl. The food was outstanding, and the service (Christine Orson) was stellar. Her attentiveness and upbeat attitude really help soften the blow of the 49ers having a bad first half, lol. The prices are also more than fair. I will definitely come back!"
1662642,"Tasty yet mild flavors that match my selective palate and sensitive stomach. I liked the simple banchan, most specifically, the soy sauce potato side dish. I got the veggie soondubu and kalbi combo meal, which were DELICIOUS. The soondubu had a generous amount of different types of veggies -- cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and onions. The kalbi was flavorful, but not too salty as it was just right. The price was reasonable for the quality of food that was served.

The waiter was nice and brought a second serving of the soy sauce potatoes without us even asking! I think that was the cherry topping on the cake. Ahh, it's definitely the little things..."
866065,"Excellent Bloody Mary's! Not a big place and getting a seat at the bar is nearly impossible, but decent service once there. Would go back again for drinks but not a place to spend more than an hour and definitely not an intimate setting."
1954229,"My mother had talked this place up a bit so I was expecting a lot and ended up with a decent experience.

The food really stole the show as the service and decor were nothing terribly impressive. 

The carbonara was amazing, and is second only to the home made stuff a close family friend makes. Their eggplant parmesan was divine, though that might have been the near excessive amount of cheese coating it. 

Would come back, but probably only if some sort of happy hour was going on."
75655,"I'm thrilled that my birthday coincided with Restaurant Week this year. Otherwise I might never have gotten to try the supreme deliciousness that is La Spiga. 

The first course was a prosciutto, cheese, puff pastry app with arugula. It was simple but delicious.   

For my entree I had butternut squash ravioli in sage butter. I'd eat sage butter on cockroaches-- my love of the stuff is a little on the extreme side. La Spiga makes all of their pasta in-house, and you can tell. It is utterly amazing. I have no words to describe the absolute heaven that my dish was. I forgot to photograph it because I was so focused on shoving it into my mouth. 

All of our dinners looked divine. They even offer a gluten free pasta! Their wine selection is great and their waiters are skilled with pairing offerings. We had wonderful service.

Dessert was pana cotta-- creamy, just the right hit of sweetness and flavor.

Parking is going to be Captiol Hill esque. You should know what that means.

P.S. They're serving lunch now!"
1133737,"Soon du bu!!

shockingly not a ton of korean restaurants in Seattle. Most great Korean options require a trip north to Lynnwood or down south to Federal Way.  The exception is the U-district which has a hodge podge of cheap Korean eats.  This is where I like to go for a nice pipping hot bowl of korean tofu soup.   Its pretty low frills and can get pretty crowded but they do a decent job getting people in and out.  

kimchi tofu soup with pork:  my usual go to dish.  They serve all their tofu soup with an egg that they crack into your bubbling broth at table side.  your nose will run for sure!

seafood pancake (haemul pajeon): great rendition here! nice and crispy and not too greasy

ban chan free appetizers: decent selection of free stuff.  A little fish cake, bean sprouts and sesame oil, kim chee cabbage, sweet potato.  

The menu is not huge but what they offer is decent and prices aimed at the college crowd it usually serves."
1020661,"This place is exactly what you'd imagine a small town diner to be like. Cozy, great service, and good food. The servers here really take the time to engage their customers. As I sat and ate, I observed one of the servers have a really in-depth conversation with an older customer who seemed kind of lonely. 

This place is close to the ferry to Victoria, BC and right at the edge of Olympic National Park, so I sense that it's more tourists than regulars eating here. But you still get that small town dining experience.

I ordered the poached eggs, and unlike other places, they offer the choice of muffin or croissant as the bed for the eggs. Also, it comes with Canadian bacon. Not the best poached eggs I've ever had, but certainly hearty and fulfilling. 

The fresh orange juice is good too, though for $4 a glass, it's a tad pricey.

Good spot overall."
1689886,"sushi was great and lots of variety. Prime rib, bbq ribs, crab and soups were also great. We were a little disappointed in the lobster, though. The lobster had large shells, but the meat were hardly anywhere to be found. We got mostly the sauce that lobster were cooked in. Maybe on another night, the lobster would have been different. The waitress taking our drink orders could have done a little better, as well, except that I think some of that was due to a very large Saturday night crowd. Even so, a little patience could have gone a long way with us. Other than that, we had a great time and food was excellent!"
1626723,"Opens at 5pm for dinner. 

What we ordered: 

**Side of bread: We got slices of wheat sourdough bread with butter. 

**Oxtail ravioli: This was really good. 

**Ahi Tuna Entree: A very generous portion of ahi tuna with really good potatoes. The tuna was very tender. 

**Crab Cakes: Must try!! Two patties served with sweet potato. The sauce is also so good!

*****Be sure to grab a handful of the chocolate mint balls! They are so good! Also sold next door at the Dahlia bakery!"
820499,"While staying in Spokane I found thus place via the IWantPro app. I ate breakfast at this cool place just about everyday. The friendly staff and reasonable prices brought me back. Standard breakfast fare menu. I had bacon/eggs, ham/cheese omelet and pancakes. All good. Coffee always kept warm."
2749434,"I don't have time to write an extensive review, so here it is. I could not believe there was a Mexican restaurant right around the corner from my place with such delicious food. The Carne Asada was amazing! The food was delicious, and we all know how hard it is to find good Mexican food. I have literally driven by there countless times and never even noticed they were there because they are well hidden. Overall, this is by far the best Mexican food I have had in WA state, period!"
1669940,Not a good value for the $$. Service was rude. 2 dry sandwiches for $27 bucks? Shards for potato chips. Took 15 mins to get food. Spend your money elsewhere!!!
986117,"As far as subs shops go they're the best I've had.  I love Jimmy Johns but i can't do it because of their radical views, this place is better than jimmy johns, is very local and is not a radical wing nut.
The grinder was very good!
i can't wait to try the Italian combo next."
2130810,Got the chicken fried steak one hung over morning and it was delicious.  The price was really cheap as well.  The only downside is they apparently don't mark anywhere on their menu that unlimited hash browns are available on the menu.  So my gf ended up eating all of her hash browns and was somewhat disappointed. Other than that the food was fantastic
1957645,"What I most enjoyed about this place was the service! The lady who helped was very nice and knew the menu well! She kept up with our table and did not give off any attitude. Also people who do not serve you are also there to help and assist

The food was great! Best drink was the  pomegranate mojito! Soooooo good tasting.  I love the happy hour! All day everyday! 

The atmosphere is amazing, fun filled."
671119,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! So glad I found it! They have great variety of Vietnamese food which I love. I am not Vietnamese but I love their food! For the drinkers, they have all types of beers for you. They also have happy hour everyday from 4-6pm and I think I will head there today as soon as I get off work."
1457595,"Came in tonight with my son.  Both ordered French Dips.  The smoked beef was extremely tender and not at all fatty.  The aus jus was very good and not salty.  I love their macaroni salad, celery, cheddar cheese, elbow macaroni, nothing fancy.  Son had piping hot steak fries, he is 12 and was happy.  The only thing I felt could be improved upon was the bun, it was that Costco hot dog, sandwich would have been outstanding with a better bun.  Service was fast & friendly."
789776,"The Silver City Restaurant & Brewery was highly recommended to me by my son as one of his ""favorite places"", and he is familiar with the area. With good reasons to celebrate, it was our first choice. We made a 5PM reservation and, since business was booming, we sat upstairs because it's not as noisy and we had a lively discussion to update each other on developments, to welcome two returning sailors from deployment, and we had an impromptu birthday celebration! Seven of us averaged just over $30 each on food and beverage, and we're certain to return when we're in the area. Positive feedback on everything from the chicken pot pie, Big Daddy Burger, the crab cakes, the onion rings, the meat loaf and everything that landed on the table! I enjoyed an IPA and another diner sampled the Who Pass Ale (9% alcohol). It's great to have a designated driver! If your travels take you to Kitsap County, add this place to your list of dining requirements."
1183423,"Came here twice in one day.. first time came with my hubs and son.. cause this is one of their fave places to go to for wings. service was awesome the first time we came in. Very very attentive considering it was happy hour and it was jam packed when we got there. I left great reviews of our service on our bill. We came back later on in the evening because my cousin from out of state was visiting and we needed a place to hangout that was open late.. so this is where we ended up. My cousin ordered the black bean burger.. which came overcooked and hard as a hockey puck.Oour waitress took it back an when we got out bill we noticed we got charged twice for her black bean burger.. Our server ended up completely not charging us for my cousin's burger. Our waitress the 2nd time for the day was just as attentive and accommodating as as our previous waitress the 1st time we came in. Actually our waitress from earlier in the day saw us again.. and she came by our table to thank us for the awesome review we left with our bill earlier.. and how her manager gave her praise for our service. I definitely recommend this place! I mean c'mon.. we came back twice in ONE day! lol

**This review is actually from last year.. I guess I just forgot to post it! DOH! But every time we've come to this location in Tacoma, we have gotten nothing but excellent service!**"
1966560,"Literally one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  The strawberry margaritas are refreshing and perfect - especially on Sundays when they have their specials on margaritas.

I'm a huge fan of Merxican food in general and Barrio offers so many options that I don't think I could ever get sick of the food.  I've been for both brunch and lunch and had an awesome, satisfying time."
1014955,"I GIVE -5 STARS... I understand its a historical building, but you don't need to keep the original DIRT and light fixtures. It took 35 minutes to make a hot dog and shake. Then my shake sat so long on their counter it was HOT milk. They are lucky I don't call the health department on them. DISGUSTING..."
673791,"I had brunch here one Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago after spending some time in the museum. It was a nice way to cap off my Sunday downtown. I had the Chicken and Biscuit and some delicious gingery drink that I can't remember the name of. It was several large strips of really tasty chicken. The buttermilk brine was really yummy and the breading had a good amount of black pepper in it which I really loved. The ""braised greens"" weren't really what I expected...it was just chopped up bits of seemingly raw kale or chard scattered on the plate, more like a garnish than anything else. The biscuit was surprisingly flavorless...the texture was nice though...flaky and crunchy, albeit a little dry. The dryness of the biscuit wouldn't have been a big deal if there had been more gravy. However there was only a very small amount of kinda bland gravy on the plate. Once I had soaked up the scant portion of gravy with the biscuit I was left with quite a bit of dry biscuit to chew on. The chicken had enough flavor to make up for the lack of seasoning in the biscuit and the gravy, and when I had a bite that included a bit of all three, the flavor was balanced. However, the imbalance of the portions of each component left me towards the end with no greens, no gravy, some really  flavorful chicken and a lot of dry biscuit. Over all it was good...I am just not sure if the chef has an aversion to salt or what. The service was spot on, everyone was really nice and friendly and I will definitely be back."
1354670,I loved the staff here! I actually stopped in for a togo order on Halloween night. They were all dressed up and so happy and friendly. Ended up ordering some subs and one was great(chicken parm) and one was waaaaay over sauced (meatball). Either way the fam enjoyed the shared dinner. 4 stars because it took a really long time for my order to be ready
244436,"I was disappointed with this place. I have been to a few other Ethiopian places. I was not impressed. I would give this place a 4 for good food, but it was served cold. It felt like they scooped it out of the fridge and slopped it onto my plate. The injera was cold as well.

We ordered the meat combo #1 and #2. Great variety and decent portions for the price paid. Was very tasty. Just didn't like eating cold food, especially since most other Ethiopian places served it warm or a little bit on the hotter side. I love red lentils and injera...I don't like it freezing cold.

The service was dodgy. The place was not full when we arrived. The wait served us our food before our drinks and plates. When he brought out our drinks, he didnt bring them all out. He forgot one can of Coke.

When my husband asked what they had on tap, the waiter said: ""If you want beer, go next door and bring in."" Kind of three us off. We have been to places where there is no alcohol but to be told to bring in our own was weird.

I will not be comig back if there are better options out there in Seattle."
807301,"Yup - it's a burger joint, with a lot of other food options.

Probably best-known for the Wednesday Burger Night - their prices are a little on the high side any other time.

They make decent drinks, although a bit pricey.  Was a little disappointed with their beer-on-tap selection."
670763,"I had a 50% off coupon from Strangermart, so my meal was fairly reasonable priced. 

If you go into this place with accurate expectations, you'll probably enjoy it. It's a greasy spoon / diner-y / Americana-y menu and a bar. They have a few vegetarian options, including mushroom gravy and Field Roast, but it's fairly meat-y and traditional. It seems like a place you'd go if you were hungover, or had a large group of people with you, or wanted to drink. 

Our server was friendly and it was a casual, fun atmosphere. I had a field roast cutlet, potatoes, and a banana chocolate pancake. The bloody mary was decent. Overall, nothing to write songs about, but it was decent."
860153,"Purple Drank!! 
Went to a birthday shindig on their badass patio and hurt myself with Purple Drank, Turbodogs, and the best gosh darn Mac 'n Cheese I've had in a long time. Best part? Grape and andouille flavored burps."
951917,"Its a nice little spot. I went there on an off night. So it was pretty dead. Reasonable drink prices. Looks like the cabaret stage or whatever is frequently used. Pretty good setup for music shows as well. I don't know if they had food, I only went for booze. Bartender is knowledgeable and can probably tell you what to get if you don't know what you want."
1012978,"We decided to try Rumble Fish because of a Groupon and the decent reviews on Yelp.  We went the day after Christmas at 11:30 and the restaurant was dark even though it was suppose to open at 11 am.  There was no sign on the door.  Despite the wasted trip, we went again a week later.  The minute we walked through the door, the waitress asked loudly if we had a Groupon (why does that matter?).  She seated the 2 of us in a booth and gave us the menu.  I told her about our previous unsuccessful visit; she did not apologize and said they were only open for dinner the day after Christmas (would have been nice to post a note, don't you think?).  She came by again and noticed I was glancing at the lunch special and immediately told me that the special was not an option (""Specials"" were NOT excluded on the Groupon).  We ordered sushi rolls and 2 udons.  The food was average.  The same waitress came by and asked if we needed anything else.  When I told her we were done, she stared at me for a while and asked for the Groupon.  We waited another 15 minutes for the bill as she was the only server in the entire restaurant.  After finally receiving the bill, I had to take it up to the counter.  The main purpose of Groupons is to entice people to try new places they normally wouldn't have.  Unfortunately for Rumble Fish, this customer will not return due to lackluster treatment and poor service."
2613024,"I guess I'll start with the name. Let me just say that even as a gay man I can't handle saying ""I'm heading to Frolik later!"" It sounds like it's next door to ""Thrust"" and around the corner from ""Pounce.""

Whoever in the Red Lion's corporate marketing and naming area decided that the insufferably-spelled-wrong-exclamation-point-like-P!nk name was a good idea just needs to take a seat: you're in for some general flack from the sensibilities of Seattlites over the next few years. 

Name aside, I stopped by this place to meet some coworkers on a Thursday night and check out the new ""Seattle Scene."" As others have mentioned, finding this place is near impossible from the lobby. Some directional signage/wayfinding would work wonders here -- and please either call it Frolik (shudder) or the Lounge on your signage consistently. After taking the elevator up to the 5th floor, you walk down a tired-2013-trend LED lit hallway to the remodeled lounge.

The new decor is just alright. It honestly looks like they just ripped out what was there and sprinkled some LED's all over the place and new furniture. Floating ceilings are an atmosphere-killer for me and scream strip-mall-quality design, so that does cheapen the whole effect. On the bright side, the deck was killer. Rivaling that of the Hard Rock, and you don't have to say you went to a Hard Rock Cafe now to enjoy a deck downtown.

The food was alright, small portions but the fries were undoubtably delicious and hit the spot. Drink menu was inexpensive for downtown, and happy hour until 10 every night is a big bonus that might make me go back. Very friendly service took care of us as well, so I can't complain there. 

Overall, I feel like ""missed opportunity"" is the key phrase here, mainly in the design. However, they just opened so maybe we just need to let this place simmer for a while and see what else they have up their sleeves. Everyone deserves a second chance, even ""Flirt!"" Sorry, I mean Frolik..."
1321137,"Delicious burgers. SO juicy. I'm only somewhat embarrassed to say that we ordered tots, fried, AND onion rings, and all three were delicious.  I was also impressed by the fact that they offer breakfast sandwiches - yum. I've always gotten takeout here, but I love the old fashioned diner atmosphere as well."
2195758,"Ok, we've gone back again and loved it even more than the first time.  Yes the acoustics are noisy, but so what.  The food is good, the wait staff is super friendly, the wait is short, and they have some friendly vegetarian (not vegan) options.  Considering how much we're liking this place, I felt Geraldine's deserved an update.

Oh, and if you pay cash, you get a $1 coupon back for every $10 you spend.  Nice!"
2161009,"First trip downtown to a nicer restaurant and it was a lot of fun.  The waitress was extremely friendly and polite and the meals renewed my sense of excitement in food.  The egg noodles were small but extremely flavorful.  Overall I loved the place and will definitely be going back.

The only downside were the bathrooms.  The men's facilities looked like someone hadn't been in to clean in a few hours and according to my date the women's was similar.  For a nicer restaurant I would expect them to have something easy like that taken care of."
1725524,"I enjoyed my first time at this Outback Steakhouse location. It's very clean with awesome staff. Our waiter was super friendly and situated the party well. My friend and I were late and he was able to situate us and order our food with no problem. The prime rib was delicious, if you're a prime rib fan, you should order it here!"
800206,"Weird location but I like the food - Pho, Combo noodle dish, spring rolls, papaya salad - all good.  Service is a tad slow but if you call ahead for pick up, it's easy to bypass the slow service.  The location is in the basement of a dingy building, but it's nice once you get inside - don't let the outside deter you!"
1338383,"I am a fan of Isan and Lao food, and had heard good things about Pestle Rock, so I decided it was time to make the Pilgrimage.

I got the Isan combo -- kai yang (grilled chicken) and som tam (papaya salad). My main reference point for both dishes is Som Tam Thai restaurant in the U District. I like Pestle Rock's kai yang better -- they use small but pretty flavorful chickens, and I found something about Som Tam's marinade a little funky. For som tam, I like Som Tam's versions better (there's a surprise). Even their basic som tam is more flavorful, and they have a few regional varieties to choose from, with dried shrimp, salted crab and the like. (To be fair, though, I tried Pestle Rock in January. Not exactly papaya season.)

I do like the fact that Pestle Rock offers both dishes as a combo, with sticky rice and the two traditional dipping sauces. I've only seen this at one other place in town -- Little Thai. I'd love for this sort of combo to catch on for other Thai dishes -- it's nice to be able to eat two or three things rather than just a pile of rice and a bowl of curry or whatever. Sort of a Thai version of an Indian thali meal.

The Isan combo is also offered with wild boar collar, and I'm sure I'll be trying that on a future visit. The rest of the lunch menu also looks interesting: a few familiar one-plate meals (basil stir fry, green bean stir fry), and a few regional specialties (e.g. kao soi, a Northern Thai curry served with egg noodles). Most of the unusual stuff is on the dinner menu. They also had a couple of interesting-looking specials this afternoon. Pestle Rock is a bit of a trek for me, but it's safe to say I'll be back. Lunchtime prices are pretty standard for Seattle Thai; dinner is a few bucks more."
832417,"Had a delicious kale and grilled cauliflower salad here for lunch yesterday. I think the food is excellent and service was, too."
1929305,This was our second stop for the night and I wish it was the first. The fish n chips and tater tots were really delicious but my belly couldn't take it lol enjoyed the brown ale but next time I will switch it up. Peanuts and plenty of people for a wed night
1732464,"I've been here twice. Delicious food for both their dinner and brunch menus.

Great ambiance and views.

Only complaints are one of their waitresses and their brunch buffet attendants - not very engaging or polite. Seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves. Would expect better service for $27 brunch."
1338340,"I have tasted perfection and it is Great Harvest Co.'s chocolate babka. Bow down to the great chocolate babka! Rich, loaded with gooey chocolate but not too sweet, they only make it during the holiday season so hurry on out and buy a loaf... or two... or three."
893381,"I have to agree with Karen D on many of her topics.  I went here because of all the good reviews and was extremely disappointed.  I only had an appetizer, the Calamari Diavola, and a salad, the Insalata Di Cesare with the added baby shrimp.   Based on the two of these I didn't order anything else.  The food was tasteless and not well prepared at all. The shrimp tasted like they were freshly thawed and thrown on the salad, they were still really cold and water logged with no flavor.  The salad tasted like it just had cheap mayonnaise on it and nothing close to a caesar dressing.  Even the wine, at $13 or $14 per glass, was not very good."
815579,"Did not like this place at all. Being in Bravern the pretentiousness was a given, but I expected much better food. Came here on a weekend from branch - and disliked the entire experience: from host greeting, waiters attitude and price and especially quality of food.

If you like Thai food, there are number of great options around 5 minutes walk away that would serve a much better meal for much more reasonable price, and provide welcoming service."
1954110,"Good but a little pricey, considering how small the portion sizes are. I would give a higher rating if the meal came with a salad and grated Parmesan instead of the powdered."
156177,"I have been going to this location for many years now and the think I like most is the never ending consistency in the quality of both the product and the service. I don't recall ever having a bad experience here and every slice of pizza you will ever have is exactly as you expect it to be. The pizza is always hot and fresh although I usually stick to a slice of pepperoni as I'm not a big fan of their more creative options, but that's just me."
928299,"This place is amazing!

I had a party of 3 and was greeted within the first 6 seconds of my time inside.The setting was quite modern and casual if you would say, very clean and having a level '2' sound volume. This place is not for loud people however, so don't try standing on tabletops or singing Whitney Houston.

Going on to the menus it has a simplistic look, although there are no photos. The waiting time in which the waiter comes back for our order can really depend on your size of party as my later returns have analyzed their coming of time. If you have a party of 3 it can take approx. 7 minutes or sooner. Ordering our foods, the waiter was pretty good at serving us, along with the efficient service of the food coming. 

The food was great beyond measures. I really enjoyed the Honey Cashew Chicken which was sweet and delicious! It provided sliced onions (and more) that absorbed the flavor which made my meal even better. The chicken is crisp and mouth dropping, just wow. Topping it off with the vegetables it also provided, especially the cashews, which was what I ate last, it was a meal that satisfied the hunger. I've tried several of their other dishes which was marvelous as well.

Their food has no MSG which made my lunch even better!

I'm not sure about how their bar goes as I've never went to that side but it's a clean area with a whole 7x6 shelf of drinks.

As for the restrooms, the men's restroom, is very clean and nice. I'm sure if the men's restroom is clean, for sure the women's is as well.

Our exiting was well, we paid at the front, everything seemed to turn out all right. I've came back here ever since, awaiting my next lunch of wonder and a great talk with the friends."
885336,"For our 5th anniversary, my husband and I decided to wing it in terms of festivities planning and chose Volterra arbitrarily. They let us reserve a table 20 minutes in advance on a Friday night for 2.5 (we wanted to bring our 9 month old and they had high chairs to boot). Pretty good start I'd say. 

We were seated in a comfy area in the back near the kitchen. The decor, while simple was elegant and inviting. Our daughter was obsessed with the white hexagonal tile work on the floor. The waitress was polite and courteous taking our drink orders. When they had brought me a glass of corked wine (read: soured due to being left out too long and in too warm a temperature), she simply took it away, opened a fresh bottle and served me a fresh glass, no questions asked. The bread on the table was warm and fresh, and came with a side of olive oil as well as some tasty fennel salt. While it wasn't traditional, it was appetizing.

We started with an arugula-beet salad with freshly toasted walnuts and a hint of cheese. Simple yet satisfying :) but the pieces de resistance were the main courses. I had a wild mushroom and pancetta spaghettini while my husband had a dungeness crab ravioli. They were both superb and divine in their own way. The meatiness of the pork complemented the toothiness of the mushrooms. The rose sauce on the ravioli enhanced the sweetness of the crab. Both offered their pasta al dente to our delight.

To finish, we shared a tiramisu which in while sweet and soothing, was a tad soft and vanilley for said dessert. We attributed it to being made with real vanilla cake rather than lady fingers. There was also a slight absence of coffee. That being said, it was still a lovely way to end a meal.

Definitely a restaurant we'll be adding to our regular go tos."
1895078,"Yum! Definitely my favorite pizza in Seattle. (We got the Margarita pizza.)

Okay, now that I got that out of the way. We came here with a big group of people to eat dinner prior to catching a great show across the street at the Tractor. The menu is set up to order small plates and share family style. Because we had so many people, I feel like we really sampled the menu. 

Small Plates: We started with the green chiles and beef carpaccio off of the small plates section of the menu. Word of warning the large green chiles are SPICY if you eat the seeds. Both dishes were very good and very simple - few ingredients - and large enough for everyone in our group of 8 to taste and for some to have seconds. The bread was a deliciously buttery-garlicy way to calm my palette after a spicy chile. We also ordered the grilled octopus - which was hit or miss, some of the pieces were a bit like smushy jelly.

Veggies: We had the kale (cold), zucchini (cold), and heirloom carrots (roasted). My favorite were the carrots, followed closely by the zucchini. The kale was unimpressive - chopped and rubbed in a vinegarette.

Pastas: We had the cauliflower ravioli and the spaghetti and meatballs. Both were pretty tastey. The cauliflower ravioli was an interesting twist on ravioli with a very light sauce and ""ribbon"" noodles that wrapped the cauliflower puree was my boyfriend's favorite of the night. The spaghetti and meatballs did not disappoint, but were more reliably traditional.

Pizza: We ordered two pizzas one with various meats and one margarita - and myriad dishes were cleared, we easily finished off both pies. I was impressed. I didn't try the meat pizza, but everyone seemed very happy with both. I LOVED the margarita pizza!

Drinks: We tried a few of the cocktails including a whisky smash and some sort of rum punch with nutmeg. We were not a fan of either. However, the beer and wine were dependably delicious."
938186,"Came to this place for lunch.  Ordered pork burgers, pot stickers, deep fried tofu, beef noodle soup and cold noodle.  Pork burgers were ok, about average, not as good as Facing East.  Pot stickers were ok, but the presentation was terrible.  Din Tai Fung has much better pot stickers. Deep fried tofu ok.  Beef noodle soup was good, spicy with good portion of beef.  Cold noodle was ok.  

Of most of the dishes we tried at this place, I can do a better job.  This is the price I paid for being lazy and not wanting to cook.

By the way, this place's MSG index is high.  I would say 4.5 out of 5 according to my scale."
1731423,"I mostly go here during happy hour and eat at the bar.  The service is very good and they serve some pretty interesting food and drink.  Jerry Traunfeld (formerly of the Herb Farm) brings his talent into nouveau Indian-esque thali with interesting flavors and combinations that rotate throughout the different seasons with use of the herb garden behind the restaurant.  If you want to sample before trying dinner, get their during happy hour M-Th and try the Happy Thali, a delightful array of five or six different items to try that most certainly gives you an idea of what their full dinner meal serves up.  

They also have some really interesting drinks at the bar.  A Tomato Trap is a savory aquavit fascination that really tickled my tongue and level of knowledge the bartenders have about local libations is extensive and accessible.  

Poppy can get busy, so I highly recommend reservations.  It will be worth your while..."
814599,"I came here while in renton for work after hearing about it from my parents, who live in the area, and from reading yelp reviews.  I enjoyed my meal and the service was great.  The steak was definitely good - but not the best I've ever had.  Because of how great the reviews are though, I think it deserves a second chance.  I'll be back."
2145053,"At first I had a bit of a hard time finding Toulouse Petit, but I am so happy I did! After walking through the curtain, you are greeted with a dinning room that is very Mediterranean meets french cafe all in a very Seattle package. At night they light the place up with hundreds of candles that makes for a very romantic evening. The food was excellent and easy on the wallet. With a friendly staff and a unique environment, it made the cajun/american food all that much better."
853575,"Decent food and beer, if overly-trendy atmosphere.

The real killer here for me is that the patio out back used to be the best place to smoke downtown. Now, with a sign that says ""employees only,"" I get to pay to watch other people doing exactly what I want to do.

No thanks."
939104,"This place is pretty cool. House beers are pretty good, I usually stick to the white ale. The restaurant itself is huge with a really nice atmosphere. I really like the look and feel of the place.

Food is pretty decent, fries could be better. What I like is even if the Taphouse is packed to the gills, Rock Bottom always has a seat open at the bar."
800424,"Following a day long commitment to whale watching, we sought refuge from the motion of our Clipper. One of my shipmates went for the kimchi and bacon while I had boar ribs and fried tofu with peanut sauce. Very well done. I will return if ever in the neighborhood again."
1679825,"A friend recommended Darby's to me because my significant other are polar opposite eaters and Darby's caters to both.

What a big mistake.
As soon as we got there, we waited. That is normal - restaurants have waits. However, the waitress wasn't even attentive and didn't even ask what we wanted to drink. She took our food order and we asked for water..... AND the water never arrived. While waiting for food, I looked around and saw the waiter and a guy that works there eating and drinking. Are you serious? You are dealing with serving food to customers and you're eating? That is beyond disgusting!

The waitress walked past us several times and didn't even make eye contact with us or attempt to even GET US WATER THAT WE NICELY REQUESTED!

Needless to say, we left. I wasn't going to eat food handled by someone stuffing their faces and serving food to customers.

If you expect your customers to live up the expectations listed on the board, ACT LIKE YOU WANT THEM THERE and serve them well!"
985222,"The decor is beautiful at Monsoon East.   Gorgeous interior, they put a lot of thought  into the design.  Catfish in claypot is lovely as are the creative cocktails.  Great place for group dining. 

I don't understand why people complain so much about prices, you are dining in a ""real restaurant"".  If you want to dine in a beautiful atmosphere and have someone serve you, provide many menu options, a full cocktail list and wine list then that's what you pay for not just the food...the entire experience.   You are in a restaurant not only to dine but be entertained."
2135708,"The Pike-Pine corrector is shaping up nicely, with a restaurant opening almost every month. More importantly, the character of the neighborhood is preserved when older buildings are retrofitted and remodeled on the inside, leaving the external appearance retaining the Seattle/Capitol Hill look. 

Now about the restaurant. This is a deep space, retrofitted nicely with a industrial/modern look. The food was exceptional, with great flavors. The service was also exceptional. (This is a new restaurant, we ill have to wait and see.) The only miss was the monk fish, which was not seasoned well. 

A word on pricing--it is not cheap, and the portions are relatively small. But I found that the ambiance, service and flavors more than made for it."
2153353,"i love everything they have here. I dont get anything like this in SoCal, where i'm from. during my stay in seattle, i would eat here almost everyday! this is no taco bell or del taco-this is AUTHENTIC mexican food made easy and fast. my recommended choice would be a torta with spicy pork."
840603,"I was really pleasantly surprised to find this place in Vancouver. I've spent a good chunk of time here over the years, and I'm not sure I've ever had a very good restaurant meal here until today. This one was really delicious, and I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area. 

The okra dish was quite tasty, although I expected it to be a little spicier. My mom got the chicken makini thali and loved it. Sambar, raita, dahl, and cabbage came with it. The dahl was really tasty, and the cabbage dish was exceptional. The sambar was pretty yummy, although a little sweet for my tastes. We also got the Abhiruchi special, which was a selection of South Indian treats. I'm a huge fan of South Indian food, and was really excited to try all of it. I wasn't super impressed, unfortunately. It included one each of two kinds of vada, one idli, a cup of sambar, and a dosa. The batters didn't seem like they'd been fermented very long (nothing was particularly tangy or very flavorful). One kind of vada was ok, but the other wasn't very good at all, the idli was bland (I know they aren't super flavorful to begin with), but the dosa was fantastic. Probably the tastiest dosa I've ever had. And it was absolutely huge! It was really flavorful (although again, didn't seem to have fermented very long, but in this case that was totally fine), and stuffed with a really delicious potato curry. I don't usually eat potatoes, but I couldn't help myself. The flavor was so complex that every bite, we recognized a new spice in it. 

And then there was the chutney. Their tomato chutney was tasty (it's more like Indian ketchup than some of the sweet Indian chutneys), their green chutney was fantastic and spicy, and their coconut chutney was out of this world delicious (we ate ever last bit of it that they served to us!)

Also, it was an absolute TON of food! We spent less than $40, TOTALLY pigged out, and had so much left over that it would barely fit in one bag. 

Certainly a pleasant surprise in Vancouver!"
593228,"I love this place and I really don't get here enough.  The Vietnamese sandwiches are just awesome.  Have it with jalapenos if you dare.  The place is popular, well rated, for a very good reason.  It may be a little hard to find but well worth the effort.  Yay for Yehs Yehs."
1344117,"Sooo I'm glad I gave Rumble Fish another chance. Their specialty rolls are fantastic! Loaded with fresh ingredients and full off flavor. My bf ordered the King Kong Roll and it was just awesome and so was the Spicy Scallop Roll. I noticed that all of their spicy rolls have great flavor and a pretty good kick (spicy tuna, spicy scallop, etc...) The Seattle Roll was pretty lame, very bland and lacked ingredients. 

We also ordered the calamari which was okay, it was a little hard to eat. The Sashimi here however is excellent. I had some yellowtail and it was super fresh and melted in your mouth.

Bottom line the specialty rolls, sashimi and service are excellent. The appetizers and traditional rolls not so much... Pretty average or lame. I will definitely be back to try other rolls and sashimi though!"
1012454,"Great burritos, huge portions, made to order all for a reasonable price."
1436555,"Some of the best pizza I've had.  Great flavor and fresh ingredients at a great price.  Excellent service, Dewan is great."
788673,"Tues 6/11/13, 6pm: Krittika Noodles and Thai/Seattle, Wa: We can't see why its current Yelp's rating has 4 stars. We've tried 3 dishes and all came out extra sweet. Fresh ingredients but too sweet. Our young daughter loved the sweet sauce, but of course. If we had known, we would ask for less sugar. Excellent brown rice but do skip the mushy jasmine and hard sticky rice, and not cheap. The meal tanked our pocket $45+ for 3 dishes (Pad See Aew, Salmon Yum Ma Maoung, Vegetables Delight). These may be the reason why the place is mostly empty during dinner hour. We've tried it with a gift certificate and not come back. 2 stars."
840318,"first off, this is not a sit-down-inside place. they have benches outside, but its Seattle and the weather might not be that great. Its in a trucker-ish area around gas stations, BUT DON'T LET THE LOCATION FOOL YOU. Anyway off to the review!!

I bought the BBQ combo platter (i think thats what it's called) and it fed my sister and my baby nephew. Everything about the platter was GREAT. i DEF recommend visiting this place if you want some good BBQ, skip Famous Daves for this place. Local joints are always better than chained restaurants!! 

i'll be back!"
2714499,"This is the usual when it comes to fulfilling my thai food cravings. As you can see from the the other reviews on this cafe, the ratings are pretty low due to the awesome customer service. I would have given the same, because their waitresses are disrespectful and unconscious of their impoliteness. My friend and I ate dinner one day and we walked to the register to pay for our meals. It's been a few years since we graduated from UW now (We were avid regular's during undergrad). But it wasn't until this year that we discovered how rude the waitresses treat their customers. They might have done something wrong with the hiring process, because I don't recall low customer service during undergrad. Anyway back to the story...My friend and I paid for our meals and right when we're about to leave, the girl goes, ""Is there something wrong?"" Our faces look quite puzzled...I said, ""What do you mean?"" She responds, ""You didn't leave any tip..."" I was a bit dumbfounded. I didn't know what to say, but I became extremely irritated. I didn't say anything, but I l recall dropping two quarters into the change jar. She wasn't very pleased.

If I'm impressed by your customer service, I will leave you a tip. But she didn't even ask us how we were doing. 

So why do I give this place 4 stars? Because of the food. It's one of the few affordable thai place I can find in Seattle. Every thai restaurant other than Banana Leaf has been quite pricey. Paying $7 for a meal is an amazing deal for a solid meal. Although the waitress's comment left a bad taste in my mouth, it didn't push my buttons to the point I would sacrifice affordable, delicious thai food. I've seen worse to be honest.

I highly recommend getting phad kee mow, phai thai and any of their curries. Their spiciness level is pretty legit. Other thai restaurants are pretty weak, but Banana Leaf stays true to heart."
1038694,"Went here a few weeks ago to get some noodles, 
The ramen was good, not the best, but I liked it, nice and friendly atmosphere, not much noise."
956170,"This is a WONDERFUL steakhouse in Downtown Renton.. We've been here a few times now. It's not a big restaurant but it's nice. The food is to die for. The Ribeye which we've tried is melt in your mouth fantastic. This is no joke. Trust me.

We've pretty much only gone here when in need of getting a juicy, tasty, steak fix just cause it is guaranteed so haven't tried much else. The sides, salad, bread, ALL GOOD. And their dessert. Being bad shouldn't taste so good. My mouth waters as I think about it!"
1035970,"FLAMING FOOD 

Perfect Teppan-Yaki / Hibachi grill dinners for steak and shrimp!  Come hungry!
Also come early but expect a wait, at least 30 mins or up to an hour even if you have a reservation.  We usually are seated in less than 30 minutes with a 7pm dinner reservation.

We usually all get the NY steak and shrimp for the grill.  Chefs are funny and entertaining.  This place is not very large, just average size dining area and they can only seat 10 people per table.

The food is good and they have a nice selection of appetizers to get us going.  We have had:  Gzoza, Yakitori (chicken),  Kushiyaki (grilled beef skewers),  shrimp & crab roll and some spicy grilled shrimp - all great!   We usually opt for the grilled fried rice (with chicken).  They cook with a lot of butter here, all the vegetables are grilled & cooked in butter.  That's why everything tastes so good!  

The younger kids did not like fire in the least and does not like the flaming volcano they make out of onions.  So if you have children, let them know ahead of time to skip
this show if they don't like fire.  Otherwise it makes for great entertainment as the chef cooks all the food in front of you.  Delicious perfectly cooked steak the way you like, eveything's perfectly seasoned and hot on your plate.  

We really enjoy the food here and will return again - a good place to celebrate!"
881750,"Sorry Charlies, after many years away I decided to meet up with a couple of friends for breakfast.  The decor hasn't changed forever and is beyond needing updating.  The tables and menu's were sticky, not to mention that I felt dirtier when I left the bathroom than when I entered.

I ordered eggs benedict.  Food arrived just barely warm, english muffins were soggy and didn't appear to be toasted.  The hollandaise sauce was obviously from a package and was somewhat gritty.  The hashbrowns were undercooked.  

Overall, the food was bland and the service was nothing special.

Charlies needs a makeover and a swift kick.  There's soo much potential to be an eclectic fun place on Broadway."
1117157,"The drinks are delicious, well-crafted cocktails. There menu is delicious. In fact, the salmon crostini might just be one of the most delicious bites in all of Seattle."
1082439,"This is not your average Pho joint, a fun approach that I enjoyed my culinary adventure via Living Social.  Very westernized interior that was welcoming and good service from the variety of staff that helped us.  Def check out the desserts, some stuff I've not seen at most Vietnamese restaurants."
208890,"I have been wanting to try Black Bottle for a while but not until last Friday I got a chance to come by for a friend's going away party. The food was surprisingly good. I've heard about the broccoli and it was indeed very tasty. We also tried the scallop/bacon wrap and the pork belly/kimchi combo. All were good choices. 

The ambiance is great for friends gathering, not so much for romantic dates. They accommodated our big party of 20 and everyone was well taken care of. I understand there should be service charge for a big group, but 20% is not the standard around Seattle - not that I would tip any less!"
270721,"This used to be my favorite ""fast food"" sushi place -- until they shortened their menu and upped their prices -- too bad, it would have gotten 5 stars. The reason I'm not giving it less than these 3 is because they do have their happy hour upstairs which is decent."
1484041,"Nice location and pretty reliable food. I know what to expect when coming here and its always a nice option when the wife and I can't decide on what to eat. 

I think this is one of the better chain restaurants in Federal Way and they are consistent in keeping the food and service good. We have gone here during all different hours of the day and even when its super packed, we usually can get a seat relatively fast. 

It really is a good option if you are shopping at the mall and don't feel like eating typical mall food, for sure makes it worth it to head across the parking lot."
213992,"I tried Rione XIII within the first few weeks of its opening and had a great experience.

The space itself has amazing ambience, very dimly lit and intimate.

My friend and I sat at the bar where we were personally served by Mr. Ethan Stowell himself. That certainly was a pleasant surprise. 

I'm a big fan of Ethan Stowell's restaurants, especially Tavolata, and the food that they served here did not disappoint. The food very rustic Roman and delicious. We enjoyed bread from Grand Central Bakery, a fried artichoke appetizer, and a couple of really delicious pastas... one was the gnocchi and the the other one was a pasta with percorino Romano and black pepper.

Umm, and did I mention that Ethan Stowell even served us our food? ;)  How cool is that?"
1119779,Party!  And party!
192051,"Delicious x 3! My wife and I wanted a small bite (or slurp) of food while walking around Pike Place Market and smelled the chowder from post alley. We used the very useful ""yelp deal"" and bought the Chowder Sampler which included: the New England, Seafood Bisque and Seared Scallop. All three was delicious and my favorite the Seared Scallop. It carried a creamier flavor throughout and there a lot of scallops in each bite.

All three were winners in my book and the rest of the menu looked very enticing. I definitely want to come back and try their crab roll :)"
1077006,"Cozy atmosphere, tasty happy hour offerings.  I wish the margherita pizza we ordered had sauce instead of sliced tomatoes.  Also, if the basil was baked into the cheese, it tastes better!  Overall a good experience though and I will be back.... but to try another type of pizza. Also, very tasty dessert options!"
1452394,"The food is generally tasty but Chipotle usually screws up either the food, the service, the charges, or all of the above.  I've twice bitten into sharp chicken bones in my chicken burrito which is why I switched to eating pork burritos.  Otherwise, they screw up my order by using the wrong ingredients when they fail to pay attention to my order, in which case they just chuck the whole burrito in the trash - what a waste! 

Also, typically they lump the ingredients in discreet globs onto the burrito which means I may end up getting a big bite of nothing but sour cream or a big bite of nothing but hot sauce.  If a customer doesn't like that, then they can request to have the ingredients mixed up before rolling it up, but I find that to be a hassle; mixing it up or otherwise layering the ingredients EVENLY should be the default, not a special request!

 I won't belabor the issue by detailing the countless screwups with the food, orders, and charges, other than to say that most times I've gone to Chipotle, something goes wrong which leaves me feeling really annoyed, particularly if we discover the problem after taking the food home.  I've correpsonded with the Chipotle management about the many screwups and their response typically leaves me with the impression that they believe in the mantra that Chipotle is always right and the customer is always wrong, which is an attitude I can't stand.  They've apparently done well in this niche, but I find the hubris and the resistance to improving any aspect of their operation to be offputting."
942694,"I can't count how many times I've been here.  I'm hundred percent sure the waiters recognize us by now the minute we walk in.  I never been to China.  However, accordingly, this is as close as you can get in Seattle.  The food can a little bit oily but you can undermine this because it marries with the taste of the food.  What to get?  Try their sweet and sour fish.  Their Kung Pao  is also very good whether you like it with Meat or Seafood.  Fish Delight, Twice Cooked Pork, Smoked Tea duck, Hunan Beef are absolutely great!  Another recommendation is Ants on a Tree.  A little on the spicy side but it's so flavorful.  The only drawback with this place is it can be a little crowded on certain days of the week.  Great staff and great service."
789861,"Was passing thru Mukilteo on a family trip, and was jonesing for some Chinese food. Found this place rated highly on Yelp, and it did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and courteous, prices were air and dishes were enormous! Especially good was the Sizzling Rice Soup, the Roasted Duck and the Chili Green Beans. Will mos def go back if I'm ever in this neck of the woods."
1324192,"I'm truly surprised by the 3 1/2 star rating -- this food is pretty dang delish, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  

I've visited Il Fornaio a couple times, both during peak and non peak hours.  I've never left disappointed, and my friends have always seemed to be happy too.  I've had a few different salads (one with seafood that was really nice), a friend had a wood fired pizza, another friend soup and salad.  All were very tasty, the portions felt just right (not too small or too big) and the breads are to die for, crusty and chewy, the way artisan bread should be.

Apparently there's a cafe in the mall, I can't speak for that, but I think it's the same food.  I've only visited the actual restaurant.  The restaurant has pleasant wait staff, is clean and quiet with great views overlooking the bustling streets of Seattle and the bathrooms are very pleasant and match the feel of the restaurant (more high end).  What else could you ask for when you need a rest from all that shopping?!"
1088148,"Good, but not great cannolis.  They have a good variety of cannolis (I only tried the mini ones).  The almond one was good.  The guy working there was really friendly."
198360,"Met some friends for dinner here, and it was as close to perfect as one could get without being illegal. The interior is modern rustic, and the menu is vast! My son and I got there a bit before the rest of our party, and the staff didn't have a problem with us waiting for them.They made sure our beverages were never empty, and gave us extra pita for our tzatziki and baba ganoush. The tzatziki was yummy with just the right mix of garlic and greek yogurt. Now, the baba ganoush wasn't as garlicy as we would have liked, but despite that, it didn't lack flavor.

So, besides that, this place has something for everyone -- the most important aspect for me is the Stevia they offer as a sweetener. Now, I don't ever see Stevia offered in a restaurant anywhere around my hometown of Lynnwood, so it was wonderful for this diabetic! So, do you want vegan or gluten free? They have it. One of the members of our party can't have gluten of any kind, so she was able to order gluten free breadsticks and a gluten free gyro. I was very impressed with that, so I give them 5 stars. But, what my son and I ordered was pretty phenomenal, also. 

My son ordered the kids' plate of spaghetti, and the portion was bigger than kid size! He ate all the noodles, and if he could have licked the sauce off the plate, he would have. I had the veggie lasagna, and it was AM-mazing. The sauce was wonderful, the portion was perfect and the veggies tasted so fresh it was almost like they grew right in the lasagna! I have to say my mouth was partying like a rock star, and it didn't want to stop. The best part is, it didn't feel heavy at all.

The rest of our party was quite pleased with their food, and we were all stuffed by the time we left. But, I MUST say good things about the bathroom here. The bathroom is clean, well-stocked and the stalls are spacious. I will definitely come back."
2158300,"Why I am a giving this gorgeous place any less that 5 stars? And let me say again.. it's gorgeous. A whiskey and bitters bar with gorgeous decor, awesome lighting and flickering candles. Why not 5 stars? Well, I can tell you that all I had to eat was the cheese plate. It had maybe an ounce of cheese. It didn't even look good on the plate. So basically I have an empty stomach. I order two drinks. The first one tasted quite good. Not much of a buzz going on yet. I'll order an aged cocktail that comes in a neat little souvenir bottle. I was in heaven when it arrived. Pretty cool. Well, I take a taste. Tasty... so tasty. Very sweet. It goes down fast. I finish quickly. I am wondering, why am I not more buzzed? I know craft cocktails. I know my body. I should be buzzed. Well, I barely felt those two drinks. What am I saying? Is it ice melt? And the aged cocktail? Water added during the aging process? I don't know. All i know is that for $50 bucks between the two of us, our brains should have felt something. Pretty place, weak cocktails."
1699119,"Probably one of the better asian food places in the Southcenter mall area. Very good options, ranging from noodle dishes to rice dishes to healthy grilled dishes. A clean, colorful environment. Highly recommended as a good place to eat if you're near the airport, but otherwise I probably wouldn't go there by choice."
808735,I love their refried beans and rice. They are excellent. The food is consistently good.
2196344,"I always have a good time when I go there with my friends. I remember especially when I went there for my 21st birthday they were super nice. The manager is seriously the nicest manager I have met. And all the other staff there are friendly as well. I have been to other sushi places like Umi and I have never gotten better service than Wasabi...I honestly would just go there for the excellent service (it makes dining so much more enjoyable)
 but the food..soo good!
Their food is delicious, I love the rolls! 
Honestly, this is my favorite spot in Belletown..5 stars!"
1948180,"My husband and I come here often.  I like to share my first experience.  My honey surprised me with this amazing experience.  He shared what this place meant to him. (Childhood Memories with his mother)  
The minute you pull up to park your car. You have a staff member car to your needs.  I felt like I was the queen of the ball and the entire staff is there for your wants and needs.  The timing of the food courses, to making the gourmet salads, pasta dishes and your flamin' dishes only in a candle lite setting and in front of your dining area. You are so just amazed with the superb treatment of your meals and they will wait to make sure you enjoy the first bite.   
I just smile when we talk or plan on returning to this Old Fashion Classic Royal Treatment of FINE Dining!!!  I am in LOVE with El Gaucho's"
922052,Their kebab selection is pretty decent (Dinner). Indian restaurants/buffets are almost a dime a dozen but this place definitely does serve up something different for their dinner. I like how you can order a la carte.
1005733,Friendly. Yummy. Hot and fresh. I love this place. Highly recommend. You do need cash though. No plastic accepted.
871343,"I have been coming here for years, and the food has always been good, but the service has steadily declined over the past couple years. Today was the last straw. We booked a table for 8, and even though we clearly indicated that two in the party would be late but we had their orders, they refused to seat us. Instead, we were made to wait 15 min while our table was given to another party. As a relatively large group, it would be a while before we could be seated as a result.

Will update more, but suffice to say manager made things right"
2158028,"The lobster, the fish, the scallops, the clams, the exotic drinks.  Whatever you get here, it's amazing.  Fresh, Seattle seafood in a beautiful setting with an amazing wait staff."
972490,"We went for breafast on Wednesday, Septmber 11, 2013. First hostess could only be described as frosty but we were hungry. Our server was very pierced and  very sweet and accomodating.
After his first bite of his eggs my husband saw a long black curley hair sticking out of the eggs and pulled it out. I discretely informed our server and she apologised and and asked what we wanted to do. I wanted to to eave, but my husband requested that they re-make his meal which they did. We then waited another 20 minutes.
The kitchen is tiny and it was apparent that it was not the chef who had deposited the hair, and when asked, the server stated that she believed it was the early morning woman who comes in early to prepare the food.
So, we finished breakfast and were presented with a bill and an apology; no offer of ""coffee while we prepare "", not so much as an offer of orange juice. yes these things happen, but for a $40 breakfast some sort of attempt to mitigate the situation would have been nice.
Never again! Woud you patronize this place?"
816916,"I've had GREAT Italian for 43 years, since I met my wife. This is NOT good Italian food. The host is very nice, but not the food. Go somewhere else for Italian."
808140,I'm Mexican from Mexico so there is nothing like the real deal Mexican food. If I'm going to be honest on the food this is as close as it gets! I always get the pollo asado when I come here. The prices and customer service are great and the food is yummy! Downs it's very small inside so at times it can get crowed and the parking lot is very small.
2163786,"Three of us came for brunch for my birthday on a Saturday around 1pm.  We had to wait maybe half an hour and were seated at a big round lazy Susan table with another couple, which was a little awkward for sharing dishes, but we didn't really mind (they did ask us).  All that aside, the food was *terrific*.  Dumplings, great.  Squid, incredibly great.  Chinese broccoli rabe and greens, fantastic.  We wound up taking a bunch of stuff to go, no problem, and it was cheap.  Friendly and prompt service.  Would come here again in a heartbeat.  Be warned that parking in the ID is tough no matter what you do."
1034128,"One of the most dynamic beer selections in Spokane. The food is top notch, but they could use more vegetarian items.  Last time I was there I had vegetable parpadelle pasta (b+).  They had Rye on Rye (12%) from Boulevard Brewing company!"
1790937,"it's been some time since my last Yelp review, but after my dinner this weekend at the whale wins, I've been compelled out of review retirement. it was a fantastic experience front to back. first, a few notes:

1) be prepared to wait. it's a buzzy new restaurant with a no reservation policy, and guess what, a lot of other people and their precious squeezes want to partake as well. if you show up peckish, do your tablemates and fellow yelpers a favor and go someplace else because you will be in full-rage hangry mode by the time you sit 2hrs later. 

2) be cool to sit at the bar. in fact, after our experience, I'd specifically request it. the service was two times the excellent as we had both the attention of the floor staff and bartender to keep us fat and happy for the duration of our meal. NB: it was pointed out to me that both the sous chef and pastry chef spend time bringing out food and waiting on diners. an uncommon practice that connects the two halves of the restaurant and has a direct thumbprint on the menu. 

3) order bread. I cleaned every last plate that was put in front of me with a piece of crusty baguette. a word to the wise: you'll want to do the same. 

the two of us arrived at 7pm on Saturday and spent the requisite 2 hours nosing around Evo and having a pint at the homey bar across the street. when we came back, we sat directly in front of the remarkable bartender jermaine, who would ply us with amazing drinks, good conversation, and recommendations all night. 

we ordered the braised greens to begin which came nestled around a soft boiled egg and were spicy, salty, and unctuous. next came the lettuce salad which was enormous and sang with tart lemon juice, creamy goat cheese, and rich nutty pistachios. then we had the braised pork shoulder which stood as being among the best treatments of pork I have ever prepared or enjoyed. finally, we capped off the night with a glass of fernet and a brownie which had the same shape and density as a gold ingot. every dish was truly outstanding and we left deeply satisfied. I'm going to be back many times, and I highly recommend the experience."
168945,"Beth's has made quite a reputation off of its 12-egg omelettes and just being a greasy spoon diner in general, which is cool and all, but nothing special enough to pull me back in for a $30 breakfast for two. We were promptly seated after walking in at 11 am on a Wednesday morning but it was 10-15 minutes before we even got another glance or a glass of water. We got the 6-egg triple bypass omelette, which in itself would have been more than enough to feed two people, but I forgot about Beth's constantly-touted giant portion sizes so I went ahead and ordered a belgian waffle with eggs and sausages. Everything tasted decent but for the price, I could have just cracked a bunch of eggs and added a crapload of salt and fat and ended up with a similar result. 

The fun part of Beth's, though (which I'm sure would be extra-entertaining to drunk people late at night), is that every table is offered crayons and white paper for coloring while waiting for their food. If you're intoxicated and super hungry and have more than a few dollars in your pocket, Beth's would probably be a great choice...otherwise, you'd probably be better off going to another breakfast joint or even just cooking up some pancakes and eggs at home.

2717855,Be prepared to wait for a seat. Not practical for more than a party of four.I had the egg nog french toast. Filling and delicious! Service is homey.
236029,Taste good and good price
1759145,"I have to admit that I was a little bit disappointed.  I used to live in Walnut Creek, CA and went to the local Stanford's several times.  The food actually was fine.  I like the condensed menu and and quality that is consistent throughout.  We had the spinach and artichoke dip...might as well go for the classic.  For dinner I had the fish tacos - also a good quality choice.

It was the service that was somewhat disappointing.  We were in the restaurant for over two hours for an appetizer, burger, chicken fingers and fish tacos.  The place was maybe 25% full...the waitress was nice enough but seemed overwhelmed by a few tables and was super slow...

If I was in a hurry...probably would not hurry back...although the food is always a good and consistent quality...."
1475247,"This might just be the best food I have ever eaten in my life. Everything is so good! I'm drooling just thinking about it. However, I had to give them 3 stars due to the WORST service I have ever witnessed! The waitresses appear to never have been trained in the customer service department. I swear I will never eat there again, but I will definitely order out;)

----------------Second Message--------------

Gencer, thank you for the taking the time to reply to my review. I think you are awesome! You are so nice to us every time we come in. You are thinking of the wrong person though. I have only been in for dinner with my friends a couple times, and the food is always marvelous. This message is not to sound rude at all. We received very bad service each time from the young female waitresses. They never came back to our table after they gave us our dinner. We never got a water refill, and I even had to get up to ask for the check multiple times. They did not help us at all. I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings. I just think the girls could use a lesson in good customer service."
239249,"Susie Rosie will melt in your mouth!  Definitely my new fav!  Have been here at least 5 times now, and it NEVER fails to disappoint.  Other recommendations:

Hotter than Hell roll - feel the heat!  This one is much much hotter than your standard spicy tuna roll.

Ginger chicken is amazing, a little bit spicy.  

Any sashimi - quality of the fish is absolutely fabulous.

Lychee sake martini...they will definitely grow on you!  

Happy hour - great prices, not to be missed.

I have one complaint - the only room they have for parties will hold about 10-12 people.  It is next to the bar, so you can't have any guests under 21.  Unfortunately for larger groups, they are just not laid out well since that is the only good area for a party atmosphere."
2162433,"I can't speak to the food, but I can speak to the drinks.  They are fantastic.  Each one I tried was a hit.

What sells it is that the drinks are very experimental, but with excellent ingredients.  No filler alcohol here.  The stuff I got was the stuff I'd use to make my own drinks at home... top notch rums in particular.

The atmosphere may not exactly be the mellowest or homeliest, nor will the drinks be the cheapest, but let's be clear: you're here for the flavors."
190110,"The food is awesome -- and the best Korean food in the Eastside, hands down.  The reason why this place is called ""Stone"" is because they serve their rice in a burning-hot stone bowl.  For those of you unfamiliar with this, spoon out the rice onto the regular bowl that they give you, but keep intact the browned, toasted rice that sticks to the stone bowl.  Then ask the staff to pour some boricha (barley tea) into that stone bowl, and let it boil away.  Scrape the sides of that stone bowl and you've got a toasty, nutty-tasting, comforting melange of toasted rice in barley-flavored hot tea.

As far as the entrees, my favorites are the spicy squid with udon noodles and the yook-geh-jang (spicy soup with green onions and braised flank steak).  My wife gets the soondubu, which is fine, though similar to that in other places.  Also, their banchan (those little side dishes that come with every meal) are excellent!

I've tried their chili-spiced chicken wings, but found them too sweet and gooey.  Based on other reviews here, though, I *must* try their regular fried chicken.  (Will update my review after doing so.)

As others have said here, the service can be a bit slow, but it's not from ill will on the part of the staff, but more from the fact that they are understaffed and the space is fairly large and awkwardly laid out.  If they can get this wrinkled, they will easily get five stars from me.

P.S.  Around the corner is Malt & Vine.  After your meal here, swing by and drink some awesome beer from one of their 12-15 rotating taps."
1335933,"I first discovered this place watching Food Network on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives so I decided to go check it out. The parking is very limited and the wait time is a bit long, but the food was pretty good. I wouldn't mind going here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast."
130795,"This is probably my favorite breakfast place in Seattle. The portions are large and satisfying. The coffee is good (Stumptown). The quality of the food is consistently good. My usual is the Grand Slam. It is two gigantic, perfectly fluffy pancakes, eggs, and sausage or bacon. The omlettes are good as well and served with a gigantic portion of hash browns. Just to keep things interesting, every month there is a different geographic theme to the hanging artwork and menu offerings."
1408975,"So friends came back from their Seattle trip raving about the food here.  While I appreciate a tasty sandwich as much as the next guy, is Paseo really worth my buddy and I taking a bus a fair distance from downtown to get lunch?  The answer: a resounding yes!

I had the Carribean Roast and it was a big messy, delicious sandwich.  The roasted marinated pork, the tasty aioli (that has just enough of a kick to make you go MMM), the caramelized onions and the jalapenos all combine to make this a memorable experience.  Props to my buddy for alertly snagging one of the few tables available in the small interior of Paseo.  So be prepared to improvise if no tables are available because you definitely want to eat your Carribean Roast while it's warm.

A couple of other good things to know.  Cash only and they do have a small restroom inside.  4.5 stars with the crazy seating situation being my only minor gripe."
1817125,"Looks like not too many new reviews out there so, having just ordered from Mehak today via the eat 24 website, I would have to say this place must of made improvements from last year. The food was awesome. I ordered the Veggie curry and buttered chicken. The veggie curry wasn't what I expected due to the consistency. It wasn't very saucy, but was thick and had potato. It was good tho. As for the buttered chicken....hot damn it was amazing. I ordered it 'hot' and FINALLY I found somewhere that delivers on the spicy. The sauce was perfect and the chicken chunks where cooked to perfection. My order time was 45-60min and I got my order after 40min and the food was hot!!"
2542264,"Serious Biscuit is outrageously good!  I used to wish that Portland's Pine State Biscuits would open a branch in Seattle, but the fare is so artery-cloggingly rich that it was probably a good thing that it was far away. 

Since Pine State was THE standard to which I compared all gravy, biscuit, and fried chicken to, I'll do that here.  

Biscuits - SB's is just as good.  I might even give it a slight edge because the crust is crunchier.  Both are heavenly.

Gravy - SB's tabasco black pepper gravy is very good.  It is smooth and rich with a slight bite.  I give a slight edge to PSB because they have a choice of two - sausage and shiitake mushroom.

Fried Chicken - Both are wonderful.  It would be a toss-up for me except that SB uses a boneless thigh and PSB uses a breast.  The thigh is so much more moist that SB gets the nod.

Serious Biscuit may have become my new favorite restaurant.  It was very crowded at 10AM on a Saturday morning.  The downstairs is the Serious Biscuit kitchen and a free-for-all seating area.  If you spot an empty seat down here, its order at the counter and serve yourself. There is about 9 two-top tables, a 5-spot counter, and four sidewalk tables.   You can get table service by getting upstairs seating.  Upstairs is also Serious Pie where good pizza is available after 11AM and stays open even after the Serious Biscuit kitchen closes at 3PM."
2143808,"definitely a must try and get there early! yes, they open at 11am...but by 10:45am there was a mini line in front of the tiny sandwich place.  by the time i ordered my sandwich, line was long!

#2 caribbean pork shoulder sandwich with lettuce, caramlized onions, jalapeno, aioli.  on man....i've had this sandwich elsewhere, but this place makes it bomb! love the huge slices of caramelized onions! jalapeno adds the spice, lettuce the crush, and the bread so chewy and rustic! delicious!!!

they have other seafood options like shrimp and scallop.  friend got the shrimp and gobbled his sandwich down.

sandwich was huge, but so good you will eat the whole thing!
cash only!!!!"
877970,Food has always been consistently good. the service however left something to be desired when the waitress approached my table as we were finishing up to let me know that there were other customers waiting. Not great customer service and something i will consider from now on when making a decision on where to go for breakfast.
809994,"My best friend wanted to take me to this place because she had come here twice in the last two weeks and was thinking of having her bachelorette dinner with 30 plus people here in September. That won't be happening now!  We have been at the Swedish hospital for days because her dad was dying and the last thing we needed was to deal with this none-sense. I ordered the tostada off the brunch menu. It says it's 11.95 & comes with my choice of chorizo, corn... so I picked corn and the waitress told me it was an extra $1 to have corn. I pointed out the fact that it doesn't say that on the menu and she argued that ""at least she told me in advanced"". I stated that wasn't the point and that I was pretty sure there is a law about things like this (which I researched and there is!). She got the manager and the manager stated the same thing but in a snoty attitude "" The menu is incorrect and we should probably change it to reflect correctly. If you would have received the bill and we didn't tell you then I'd take the $1 off, but we warned you so you will need to pay the extra $1 if you want corn."" I told them to remove my item from our lunch order and decided to go to chipotle instead. Terrible shady service! I can afford the extra dollar but to be rude about it is another thing! And to say what she said was ridiculous. We will never go there again. 

In addition they don't give you free salsa with your free chips. The food is expensive for the portions you get. 

This place only gets 2 stars for good food and nice decor."
830297,"Came here to grab some food and head next door to eat at Montana. We got the roti, nasi goreng, and anther salad-type dish that had cucumber and duck egg. I was really excited for the roti, because I love roti. The nasi goreng was great, but a little too spicy...and I like my food really spicy. The salad-type dish had a perfectly boiled egg on it. The roti was AMAZING, but it only came with one, for 4.50. I was definitely disappointed about that. Everything was good, but for the price, not amazing. I will be stopping by late night for that burger..."
1258910,"We love the food at The Hearth.  It's amazing each time.  It doesn't really matter what I get, it's always fantastic.  I'm very picky about foods not being greasy and loaded with salt.  So I love the fact that I can eat here, and not feel terrible afterwards!  The wood fired pizza is great.  If you don't have a garlic sensitivity (which we unfortunately do) - try the Thai Pizza... it's amazing!"
1954367,We love this place. There homemade past is wonderful and you have to have there Drunken Clams!!! the best clam we have ever had. the ouzo they put in it take claims to the next level. Even though the Cow changes with the season it is amazing anyway they prepare it. It is really hard to bet the Elk Bologna's also!
996080,We ate there tonight. A squash /mushroom and pesto tart and the prawn pasta. The tart was average..the squash not a good idea thought sounded yummy...I ate most of it but I was starving! It would have been better without the squash..the pasta and prawns ..good.. What you would expect .The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice.. Quiet and a relaxing vibe.. The prices are not bad..better than Chicago for sure and I would expect this is one of the nices places to eat in this small quaint town..I would come back.
1279302,"What can I say... I use Yelp often and the positive reviews for Backwoods Country Fare Cafe were spot on! Dora and Juan have such a great place! The service is right on par with the high Yelp comments that I expected and the Backwoods Crunchy French Toasts rocks! :) Thanks for the great service, atmosphere and food!"
2129651,"Big fan of this place. I love how different it is from other restaurants. 

NOTE: it is NOT your average Korean food joint so don't be expecting that. 

I brought some friends who were disappointed that they weren't getting the ""usual"" Korean buffet. 

I love the fact that during the summer they BBQ different items, the changing menu and the staff are great. 

The only reason why I am not giving the full 5 stars is the reservation policy. Reservations are only placed for 6+ groups (which is understandable) and you can only make them at 5, 7 or 9 pm. 

That's all.

I LOVE THE RICE and NOODLE BOWLS =D"
958580,"Excellent sushi, great prices and very friendly service."
902454,"It was a really fine sunny day and we found the perfect spot to soak it up. The breakfast buffet for lunch was slightly strange yet yummy, the waiting staff were slightly caught off-guard with influx of people, yet friendly, our server was slightly t eager to take my plate away (for a buffet sit-down), yet diligent. Nice spot, young staff compliment, but good vibes and overall fun excursion."
1167748,"A group of friends went to Truce Spa for a bridal shower and were topping off the night with dinner at Wild Ginger. We all love Asian cuisine and only the bride-to-be had eaten here before. Our appetizers were delish! We all ordered food and shared. The chicken phad thai was good, the duck was amazing and the 7 beef dish was succulent. The prices were reasonable considering our location. Overall the aesthetics were pleasing, our server Paul was delightful and the food was fantastic!

The staff was very helpful when none of us could figure out where the bathrooms were. It was a busy Thursday night dinner crowd so I wasn't too critical when I had to pick up loose debris off the bathroom floor and wipe off the watery counter before I washed my hands. Maybe that's the OCD in me, but its hard for me to leave an upscale restaurant littered with unnecessary clutter. We had an enormously lovely time together laughing and enjoying the eye candy. I highly recommend Wild Ginger at this location. There is plenty of shopping and other local amenities that make it a great experience. The parking isn't so fun, but it is Bellevue."
1895112,"I'm so happy we found this spot for lunch right past the farmers market. This is the best pizza I have ever had. Seriously, you would think they would have a good pizza somewhere in L.A., but nothing even comes close to this place. 

We split a margherita and a mortadella and olive pizza. The crust was thin, but had enough density that it didn't droop and sadly dump the toppings onto the plate (I hate that). It was crunchy on the bottom and soft on the top, and not dry at all. The sauce had a little kick to it, but the chili pepper that they brought to the table really made it perfect. 

The decor is a mix of antique and modern with an eclectic twist, and the curved bar is super cool. I definitely had a thing for the light fixtures, but I'm weird like that. I loved that the front of the restaurant is exposed, there was a perfect and gentle breeze at our booth. 

If only I could bring this gem back with me to California! Guess I have a good reason to come visit Ballard again."
970828,"My favorite new Eastside sushi place!   We always sit at the sushi bar and get the chef's sushi pick.   It's is sooooo fresh and yummy and I have never been disappointed.   The spicy tuna hand roll was my fave the last time I was there, large pieces of fresh tuna (instead of chopped and mashed up like most places) DELISH!  Highly recommend this place, but then again I don't want everyone to know about it and take my bar seat! :-)"
1650871,"Walk up window with pretty fast service.  The food is good, the sitting space is small and crowded, but it's nice to see them prepare the food right there.  We had fish and chips, clam chowder and raw oysters - all were great."
1962437,"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. I went tonight and I'd go again tomorrow!
I have no reason to not give this place 5 stars. I've had Mexican a lot recently (at a far inferior AZTEC restaurant and also the newly disappointing La Corona). I haven't been impressed with Kirkland Mexican food, and I wasn't expecting to be impressed here. But I'm happy to be wrong. 
The ambiance is lovely, the staff is sweet and attentive. I kept asking for more chips and salsa because they were AMAZING and I was very hungry... No one made me feel bad about it. We ordered the appetizer guacamole and it was fantastic. Fresh, light, happy-tasting. 
The food didn't take too long and it was delicious. I ordered 2 veggie enchiladas and a chicken enchilada with a cream cheese sauce (I was told next time to just ask for the white sauce). It was FANTASTIC. The veggie ones were more flavorful than the chicken in my opinion... And If you're not a big cheese lover I'd ask for less or no cheese, but that's just me. 
I loved my meal so much I brought home a chicken quesadilla (which was also great) and they even packed chips and salsa to go too.
AND our sweet waitress took a million pictures for us and actually tried to make them look ok :) I wish I remembered her name. But good job waitress!"
835321,Service/bartender was attentive $8.00 for house margarita. Ok...a bit pricey. But good. Happy Hour menu perfect and delicious. Mac/cheese with Beef skewer was yummy till meat was too fatty. They gave me a new skewer and it was delicious a bit of wait ...a bit disappointing . Wine tasting at 6 p.m. for $10 was wonderfully done! Music started at 7 instead of 6 but added a nice touch. Will come again and maybe monthly. :)
1078856,"Great place to eat, with plenty of food choices, and friendly wait staff. I think I've been here 4 times in the last year or so, once with friends, once with family, and two date nights, and have never been disappointed. Pricing is very reasonable, and the atmosphere is comfortable & decent. Get there by 6 pm for a fair Happy Hour pricing, and fast delivery to the table!"
854532,Great good...we went for breakfast...I had the salmon and my wife had the eggs Benedict...both very good...we also got a side of the bacon and house made sausage...both incredible...be prepared to wait for a seat...we waited a while...enjoy!!...;-)
1034449,"It's more like 3.5 Stars. But, I rounded it up since it's in Lynnwood area. And, there's a good sign that majority of the customers I saw were Asian. That says a lot about it!

My friends and I came here after a hike up north. We stopped by here to grab post hike meal! My friends are big fan of Szechuan and we've tried a few Szechuan places together in the past couple years. This one may not be one of the best but it's pretty good!

I believe the restaurant used to be a Chinese buffet in the past. It's very spacious I really like the wide space. The wide space made us order more than we can eat :P 

Among three of us, we ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entree dishes, and also steamed rice. Personally, liked spicy bean jolly, spicy beef tendon, and lamb. The special Szechuan sauce in the bean jolly was actually really good. There's a good flavor with beef tendon and it's not too chewy. The lamb was tender and the green in the dish was pretty good (it's either cilantro or parsley). My least favorite dish was actually one of the classic Szechuan dish, Boiling Fish (I think they call it something else). They do put more veggies than just cabbage, but the dish itself was just blend! The other dishes were ok.

I loved the parking! I loved the friendly staff. I do want to go back again and order in Mandarin Chinese and see if I can get anything more authentic! :-)"
179578,"A group of my colleagues and I went for lunch here last week forgetting how appallingly bad the accoustics are so it's not good at all for a big group or the hard of hearing. The food was disappointing. I had fish and chips which was bland with thick, doughy breading. Edible but just barely."
947270,"We've only ordered take-out. They are incredibly prompt -answering the phone and in having the food ready, generally 15-20 minutes. Also very friendly on the phone. We mainly order curry dishes and noodles --all very tasty with fresh ingredients. My only complaint is the inconsistent spice level. I can withstand heat/spice, but I don't always want torching spicy food. I have yet to find the appropriate level to request. I've tried 4, 3 and 2 and they all seem to be a 4. My husband has taken to 0 or 1, but then again he can't take any heat."
162700,"Came into Joule a few minutes before they opened to review the menu and found it contained some Kalbi meat dishes; so we settled at the bar for a few drinks.  I ordered the 12 year Glenrothes Select Reserve on the rocks that was really exceptional.  The ambiance of Joule is very comfortable and you can easily settle in and relax in the bar or in the dining area.

After we were seated, we ordered a couple of entrees; the Kalbi burger and the Kalbi steak with grilled kimchee.   One bite into the burger and it exploded full of juicy goodness; perfectly medium rare, gorgeous red color and had a wonderful meaty taste with a nice charbroiled flavor.  Its taste and texture was way beyond my expectations of ordering the most unadventurous item on the menu; a burger.  The bun complemented the meat and there was no need to add cheese or condiments to mask that meaty taste.  This has to be one of the best ""undiscovered"" burgers in Seattle (see photo I posted).

I like the way Joule does meat!   

Afterward, what was notable was the apple bread pudding desserts that had that homemade look and taste that was complemented by some smoky buttermilk ice cream.

I found the service to be just right and everyone I had contact with were pleasant and we enjoyed the experience of coming to Joule."
258207,"Urbane is nice, with caveats. Lunch will definitely take you an hour, if not more, due to delays from getting food from the hotel kitchen to the dining room. Food is local, well presented, and super tasty, but expensive for what you get and how long you wait for it.

Drinks are rather overpriced, as opposed to kinda overpriced for the food. The atmosphere is quite modern and pleasant, and service is good but not exceptional. 

I really admire what they're trying to do with local, in season, etc. but they could do better."
848230,"It's always packed, but the line always goes quickly.

Their baguettes are amazing.
Try the Kringler, Ham and Cheese Croissant, and their Twice Baked Almond Croissant...

You won't regret it."
1399215,"Still love it here!!!  Great food, great service,  & great prices on wine!!

The lunch wait staff is fabulous, I have only had dinner here once & my server was someone I normally see for lunch, so I can't speak for the evening staff.  Robyn, Caesar & Oscar are my favorites & are phenomenal servers! 

I don't eat much in the way of meat- but will review things I LOVE here.

Roasted Veggie Salad - I get this almost every time I eat here.  I ask for light dressing.

Split Pea Soup - Soooo good!!  Has barley in it which adds awesomeness to the texture so your not just eating pea purÃ©e.

Tacos -
My friend LOVES the carnitas tacos.
I tried the fish tacos - the fish was good but the rest of the taco (coleslaw, mayo, etc.) was YUCK!!!  So now I get the carnitas tacos (cilantro, salsa & more awesomeness) but sub the panko mahi mahi for the carnitas meat & it's REALLY GOOD!!!!  

Wine-
BEST PRICES!!!!!  They beat pretty much EVERYWHERE in downtown Bellevue on their prices per glass by like $2 each glass!!

I have NEVER had a bad experience here, in fact I've never even had a mediocre experience here.  It's always good!! :)"
1967883,"Love going for happy hour. The wedge salad and wings are some of the best I had and at $7 total its a filling cheap eat. 

However, the service could have been better. I was dining by myself so the bill wasnt large, but I go out often and like to tip very well. The waiter was cold, didn't smile, and made me seem like I was a bother to help. I'll go back with some friends, but not by myself."
174150,"Their menu is a short novel with tons of options (including a variety of bread and side choices with some meals), but there's nothing notably special about any dish. What you can expect is a decent meal in huge portions and lots of leftovers to take home. This is not the place for a light eater.

I'd recommend it for large groups of people that are easy to please. They've got standard favorites from ribs to chicken pot pie to pizzas and calzones; everyone is bound to find something they'll like. Plus, you'll need a few friends to tackle their monstrous desserts.

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, but it is one of the better choices within the mall area and not a bad place to meet up before catching a movie."
891878,"Scrambles are bland... pretty pricey, not very memorable."
990319,"Well, the honeymoon is over.  They now serve Pad See Iew like every other place on the ave with broccoli and carrots.  No more gai lan.  Oh well, it was good while it lasted.  It's still a good dish, but it used to be great.  Also, comes with rice on the plate now, which it never did before.  In other words, now the portion is smaller and the rice fills up what would otherwise be empty space on the plate.  And pretty skimpy on the broccoli.  Kinda disappointing. 

Also, not much ambiance late at night.  The really nice servers seem to work during lunch.  The evening/late night servers are nice too, but the guy that used to be there at lunch was just the nicest ever.  

Also, dishes are crazy salty now.  I couldn't tell if the spice was burning my mouth or the salt.  I think it might have been the salt."
895977,"I've been on a huuuuuuge veggie burger kick as of late. While my body went three hours to the past and to the other coast. My appetite remained the same.

Veggie burgers.

Who am I to say no to so simple a desire? I did my research [thanks fellow yelpers!] and I ended up here. Oh, more than one veggie burger? You don't say! I had the hawaiian veggie burger and part of the mushroom swiss, minus the mushroom. I definitely enjoyed the hawaiian more. I just felt like it was a better combination.

Food came out super quick, and my mister ate like 4! Everyone was super pleasant. I loved it!"
1140217,"This is the best Mexican food I've had between Southern California and Washington. Taqueria La Venadita is no joke. Carne Asada is delicious (get the full plate, not the taco). Anything with chorizo will satisfy your porky needs. 

If you're willing to dive into the truly delicious without always ordering the typical mexican fares I'd highly recommend their posole. I turned on to this magical soup after observing an elder latino fellow. He appears to be restoring his soul with the contents of that bowl. Now I know why. Taqueria La Venadita's posole is magical. Like unicorns. F*$&%ing Delicious unicorns."
251733,"Fancy menu for happy hour, but lacked in flavor.  It doesn't matter how good food looks if it doesn't taste great.  

Same goes for drinks.  The Gingertini and the Mojito weren't made well.  Strong, yes.  But it didn't taste good.  Everything just seemed off."
1480985,"Whats not to like? You can order online,  on the phone or even go in for better deals then delivery. Pizza is always fresh out of the oven and loaded with toppings. Customer service has improved a lot sense the rude gray haired person left. When calling ask for the 2+2+2 special, it is simple and is a great deal. 2 large 2 topping pizzas and a 2 liter of soda."
1217240,"Not my cup of tea. I can't say if it is my taste buds or the food but the soup wasn't that great- the noodles were about the only good thing in my opinion. The soup was fatty, lots of bones and tendons and had an overwhelming anise aroma- the fried rice was less than desirable."
1659745,"I booked Grim's Butterfly Room for my best friend's engagement party and the Grim's staff basically made me look like a master party planner- they made everything so easy. My point of contact Lindsey was great to work with; she always got back to me and answered all of my questions in a friendly, timely manner. The staff was extremely friendly: let us play our own music, adjusted lighting so we could play a slide show, was great about picking up empty plates and glasses, even adjusted the temperature. Our bartender Caleb was a true master and people who hadn't planned on drinking ended up doing so because of the rave reviews they were hearing. Caleb highlighted the difference between a mixologist versus a plain old bartender. Caleb was great as our own bartender, he was extremely attentive, could tell if we liked our drinks and had no issue replacing a drink if one wasn't what we expected. The room was ideal for 15-25 people and has decor that simply cant be beat- very classy, unique, and comfy. And the food was GREAT. In short, everyone loved it and had a great time. I would throw a party here again in a heartbeat, as would the other guests.

Prices (cheaper on weekdays):
Room charge: $250

844097,Love this place! Every time I'm feeling like getting breakfast I go here. The service is good and the food is good. I would recommend!
873195,Overpriced Denny's style food.
798941,"I love this place! My first time going there and was incredibly impressed. Its a tiny place and it is loud but they have an open kitchen which I love. Everything was so clean and sanitary looking. I sat up at the bar to watch the kitchen staff, the bar looked like an old flat top grill (pretty neat!) There is a delicious salsa bar that you can help yourself to, the pico de gallo was fantastic. It probably took a while before someone came to get our order, but we didn't care because we were fascinated by watching the kitchen staff work so smoothly. 
We ordered chips and guacamole, their tortillas are homemade, we watched one of the workers press and cook them the whole time. The guacamole was fresh and had the perfect amount of lime or lemon juice. Halibut tacos were wonderful, they were juicy, flaky and had a fresh taste. The rice and beans were fantastic! Some of the best I have tasted in a restaurant, definitely authentic.
I will be driving back to Seattle just for the food here!"
878639,"Over-hyped.

We were visiting Seattle and according to Yelp this was a must try. After waiting in line for over 35 minutes we finally made it to the front of the line. 

We got the four 5oz sampler - Seafood bisque, Chicken and corn, the halibut chowder and the seared scallop chowder. We couldn't quite tell the difference between the halibut chowder and the seared scallop chowder. Both were overly creamy with not much flavor. The chicken and corn was okay. 

The crab roll was a bit to watery..the bread got soggy quickly. Overall the meal was not horrible, but definitely not worth the long wait."
1895885,"We were in Seattle celebrating our anniversary.  We wanted to try some foie gras, since it's banned in California. It was labor day, and Le Zinc was the only French restaurant open! I was so happy. We tried the foie gras fries, baguettes with butter, and pork belly. Our first foie gras experience was fantastic.  The service was great, bartender was very attentive, even though we did not order much. I wish we had ordered more food and some cocktails though, maybe next time!"
793676,"I'm really not sure where all this recent hate is coming from, but once again, I had a lovely experiencia gastronomica. 

I had the carne asada (again) and my friend had the carnitas colorado. We were both extremely pleased with the food. Both meats were tender and juicy while the rice and beans were delish. Just a note for those complaining about rice and beans- they are, by nature, BLAND. If you need more flavor, walk yourself back to the salsa bar where there are about five types of salsa you can dump on top of them. Personally, I thought they were perfectly seasoned. I'd prefer under- to over-salting any day. And I'm super pumped they're not refried beans. That cheesy sludge does nothing for me.

I can't think of a better place to eat away the day's productivity (not to mention the most you can pay is $20 for two people including tax and bevs)."
824877,"Been meaning to go there for MONTHS. Finally committed to it. I decided to go simple, a cheeseburger so I could see how good the burgers are without all the customization (they have a TON of special burgers- Greek, etc.).

This is fantastic! This is a great burger. I'll be back. It really doesn't need much more said- great staff, great food, and it's ""the little guy,"" a small locally owned place. I like that as well."
176646,"Quick service and decent Chinese food. I can't say I was blown away by anything but I certainly ate everything that was on my plate. 

I also loved that they have large round tables for groups that are bigger than 4. My friends and I were looking to stuff our faces after New Years and Chinese food seemed to fit the bill. We ordered a ton of food and had a great time."
880437,"I love this place! The coffee is amazing! I had the cappuccino and a Bagel. The cappuccino was delicious, but I could not say the same about the bagel. 

Overall definitley worth it for the coffee, but thats it.

Probably one of the best cups of coffee I have had in Seattle in a while.

SO GOOD."
1135543,"Really cheap food here; 10 of us ended up stuffing ourselves for a total of $50...for ALL of us.
It isn't really pretty inside, but the service is very fast and delicious (for the most part). Some things are not too good, like the shrimp noodle, which is kind of mucus-like. You just have to know what to order. I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings.
Plus they didn't accept card payments from any of us, even for amounts for more than $10."
2543106,"Tom  Douglas!!!

I am a big fan of Tom Douglas's other restaurant, Serious Pie so I was really anticipating checking this place out! 

My family and I ordered a bunch of different biscuits to try out and I have to say I could just eat the plain biscuit by itself with the house made preserve. or you can choose to get bacon butter with it. The biscuit was nice and hot when we got it; it was crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft in the center. I am generally not a huge fan of biscuits, but the biscuits here are yummy!

As far as biscuit sandwiches goes. The best one was the one with the homemade ham, egg, and BEECHER's cheese with the mustard. The ham was delish! It wasn't to salty or anything, but perfect. 

For sure a go to place when you are visiting Seattle. Great to pick up for breakfast too is you are on the go. I can't wait to try more of Tom Douglas's restaurants."
995303,"Growing up, my dad would make chorizo and eggs on Sundays. Now that I only go home a few times a year and I don't trust myself to eat only  reasonable portion of said favorite breakfast entree, I seek out places who do Mexican breakfast well - and I can stop looking now.

I've been twice now; The first time I strayed from my standard and ordered the machaca and eggs with corn tortillas and absolutely fell in love with what was on my plate. The meat was perfect seasoned and accompanied by a pile of refried beans and potatoes. I have a gluten sensitivity and I usually ask when ordering about gluten in things, but I didn't about the corn tortillas and the second I took a bite and discovered their lovely, chewy texture I realized 1. that I should have asked and 2. that I didn't want to know because I was going to eat all of them anyways - fussy body be damned!. Know that if you do have major gluten issues, you should ask about their corn tortillas you should probably ask because I suspect they're a corn/flour blend, but please, like I said, don't tell me... I'm lying to myself and I don't want you to ruin it for me. 

My second visit I went back to the old standby, chorizo and eggs. It was good... though I don't know that it can compete with dad's. The flavors went great with the red salsa they brought out, but I was still wishing I'd just ordered the machaca again. 

They also have breakfast until quite late, which makes those of us who are unable to drag themselves out of bed at a reasonable hour on their days off happy."
801988,"Here's the thing with Pho Hoa - it used to be a fantastic deal because the regular bowl had a giant bowl of noodles and meat, and was $5.45. Broth isn't as rich and flavorful as you like? It's $5.45. Tastes like bleach water? Put some more Sriracha and plum sauce in there, because it's $5.45. 

I went in there yesterday and it's now $7.50 for regular and $8.45 for large. Extra Sriracha isn't cutting it any more when I have to pay an extra $2 for a bland bowl of pho with a bunch of fatty meat. At lunch, $2 is material, damnit, especially when the service is as mediocre as Pho Hoa's. 

So why go back? Personally, I won't. But why would somebody else go back? If you're looking to bang out a 30 minute lunch, this is the place to do it. You'll have restaurant staff at your table asking for your order before you see a menu and the food comes up in less than 5 minutes. Plus, it's gone from being one of the most crowded lunch places in Redmond to half-full at any given point, so there's no wait. Turns out, there's a lot of people that are just as cheap as I am..."
810595,"Good food, good service and great atmostphere. 

Had a mid-day lunch- loved the range of specials on the menu as well as the staple brewery fare (burgers, pizzas, fries).  They make a killer root beer as well!!!

Fries are amazing... crispy on the outside and buttery soft on the inside!  

Try the specials and the house-made soup is is delish!"
182963,Good fish tacos!  Quiet room in the back for our large party!  Efficient and quick waitstaff.
819705,"Went there twice in a roll. Wish I had more opportunities to try all of their menu items. 

The sandwiches are simple and so flavorful. I had the brioche with eggs, bacon and salad. Looked so so, but the first bite changed the game. 

Not cheap, but worth every penny."
818627,Dukes has one of the best happy hour in all of West Seattle. Great atmosphere. Scott is the best. He is always so sweet and helpful.  We will be back!!
1735943,I absolutely loved it here (: My good friend brought me here today it was nice I liked that it had a play area so my daughter was able to have fun while I had a nice catch up with awesome people. Food is a little pricey but delicious and I love the build your own menu (:
2145315,Best happy hour ever.
1517183,"This place has seen way better days.  But it does the job of entertaining a bunch of 30-40 year olds who remember what it used to be.  We came here last night (02/15/14) because the other place we went to had a 2 hour wait for both pool and bowling.  It was not busy (at all).  So we pretty much had a pick of pool tables, which was actually good, we weren't really looking to party.  There were no obnoxious punks, everyone seemed to be there to chill, as did we.  We ordered a pitcher of Stella Artois, it was flat and practically stale (we should have complained but we didn't).  We actually did have fun.  We took turns playing pool, playing ping pong, and playing video games.  Overall a decent experience, but not generally on my radar for ""must-go-there-spots"".                     Show owner comment »"
16693,"I'll be giving them another shot.  A day after posting this review, I received a message from the owners that was very apologetic and they seemed genuinely concerned at handling the situation.  If the attentiveness of ownership is any indication, the service I got was a fluke.  I'll post again once I've had a chance to revisit but for now I'm bumping my review to three stars."
1298352,"i was so excited to find out this was the same food from the mediterranean kitchen in bellevue , but cheaper!!!!!! you get a little less, which is fine by me, but still just as garlicy good!!!! its much more casual dinning style but great for a quick lunch."
979252,Amazing Father's Day Dinner! Service was fantastic. Blackberry salmon was divine. Couldn't have asked for a nicer service- from the hostess to server to manager checking in! Thank you! One of my Dad's fav places
829038,"Great place to sit down and relax. Beautiful decor, relaxing atmosphere, good food and drinks, and a friendly staff! Tyler is one of the most polite servers I've come across. Will be coming back :)"
1255681,"Went here for lunch with my friend. I had been here once before. This is kind of a hole in the wall place. It benefits from the other places nearby not serving lunch. 

We were the only ones there on a Friday at noon. This was a little surprising once we got our food. It was great! 

My cheesesteak sandwich was everything I would want. I probably would have been happy with the bread alone, it was that perfectly toasted. I know that sounds lame, but if the bread's not right, the whole sandwich isn't right. Accompanied by a Caesar salad that hit the mark with two kinds of Parmesan and crispy croutons, I couldn't have done much better. 

My friend had a pizza (I forget the name) with white sauce, chicken, sundried tomatoes, and pesto. The crust was a nice balance between crisp and chewy. I wished I were taking home her leftovers myself! Tip: Spend the extra $2 for the house salad. 

Considering that we were the only ones there, it's not surprising that the service was attentive. My only real quibble was the choice of music on the sound system. My friend liked it, though. 

You should go here, and not just to encourage them to stay in business. The food is worth the visit."
981693,"Do NOT be disuaded by the fact they do both burgers and Gyros - this is an AMAZING BURGER JOINT!!  

I read some of the other reviews and saw the comment about ""Like us, do a review on Yelp"" or something to that effect. I never saw that - I am here solely on my own will. On top of that, I hardly EVER do reviews - only if the place is horrible, or amazing. This place is AMAZINGLY GOOD.

I have driven past several times, thinking, ""That place looks like it could be pretty good...""  Yesterday, I had a  couple minutes, so me and my 8 yo daughter stopped in. 

As we parked and walked in, we noticed an older gentleman tidying up outside - working in his cute little black polo, which matched the cool ""devilish"" red-and-black decor. Which, by the way, if very clean, and very cool. But of course, the best part: the food....

We ordered the number five, which is a jalepeno, bacon and cheese burger w/ chipotle sauce, and a regular cheeseburger for the girl. Love at first bite. Seriously. Even my daughter liked the onions, ""The best onioins I ever tasted,"" she said, and she is very picky and hates onions. Go figure.

My burger was amazing. The fire-roated jalepenos were plenty, and bright green and crunchy - just the right amount of heat. The bacon was cooked to perfection, and spilled out of  the burger. I liked that it came with a plain bun rather than the sesame-seed one which was what the cheeseburger came with. The bun was not too ""bread-y"", and the burger was the right amount of sloppy - everything melding nicely as we ate the burgers, but came nice and neat looking. 

The cheeseburger, only $2.29, came (surprisingly) loaded with everything, and plenty of it.

We finished, and I had to go in and make a compliment. After all, Everett NEEDED this place. As far as I know, the nearest good burger joint is Five Guys in Marysville. Nick's Junior is better. And they have a bigger menu. I asked the cashier how long they had been there, and she quizzically replied ""Three months?"" as she turned to look at the older gentleman who was now working behind the counter. He asked if I enjoyed it, and I said it was amazing. I asked if he was ""Nick"" and he said he was, and immediately came to the counter to shake my hand. I said it was really good, and told him we will not only be back, but I will tell everyone I know how good it is. 

Pros:
Nice guy, clean place, reasonable time on order (especially considering how fresh it was), very good prices, friendly staff, amazing quality food and selection, outdoor seating.

Cons: Only one: It would be great if they had a drive-through! 

Oh, I have a feeling there may not be enough seating when people realize HOW damn good this place is, but that's nothing. The food is hot enough to take home to eat.

UPDATE: Ate there again today and turned my neighbors onto it - they were amazed. I knew they would be - they have good taste. Greek fries: killer. Nick's Special: outta this world. California burger: perfect, including wheat bun! Puts all other burger places to shame; nay, makes those panty waists run home screamin' to their mommas... yeah, that's right."
1897882,"Review is for breakfast. Very good!  I had the half chicken and my other half had the corned beef hash with poached eggs. Both delicious. The potatoes in the hash, small and very 'new' new potatoes were a little numerous but it's a small quibble. Tried the lemon glazed jelly donut and whiskey cake. OMG. Yum!  Want to go back for dinner. 

Service was very pleasant and efficient."
1226358,"The pizza, the family who owns/cooks, is awesome.  Highly recommend going for anyone who likes pie."
1901266,"This is my favorite pub. The bartenders are amazing. They're friendly, they remember everyone's order, and keep separate checks straight for large groups. It's actually really impressive. 

Kate's is not a true sports bar, but there are plenty of TVs. That means I can come here to watch sports and support teams that are not local.

Awesome happy hour every day 4-8pm. Half off all food with a drink purchase. That means $6 for a burger with whatever you want on it and a side. My go to order: veggie burger, cheddar, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, guacamole, BBQ sauce, and a fried egg plus a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Yup, I'm drooling now."
667472,"I work not too far from here and was excited to learn of a nearby Thai place.  I met a friend for lunch here recently and, unfortunately, have to say my overall impression was a pretty large ""meh.""

The good:
-- Super friendly and efficient service.  The good folks working the dining area kept my water glass filled even after our plates were long empty and we were just sitting and gabbing.
-- Low prices.
-- Brown rice offered as an option over white rice at no additional cost.

The bad:
-- The food was just not that good.  This is an order-at-the-counter and take a seat kind of place,  Your food is brought out in about 30 seconds, so clearly is long-cooked and sitting in a warming pan.  I had the green curry, one of my favorite meals on earth, and it just did not taste fresh.  It was not spoiled, by any means, but did have ""just this side of past its prime"" vibe going on.  And, though it had some heat about it, it just did not have much by way of flavor.   (Each dish is billed as ""mild,"" ""medium,"" or ""hot,"" and because everything is pre-made, you don't to customize -- though they offer a good selection of chili sauces so you can spice your own.)

The place was hopping at lunchtime and, because the food is served so quickly, tables turn over quickly.  But, it was surprisingly not too loud for all the hoopla.

Overall, though, definitely a disappointment.  Probably better for my waistline and pocketbook, but I would have loved to have found a source for a lunchtime fix of good Thai food.  ::: sigh ::::"
2782212,"This is the worst beer I've ever had in Seattle. Its stringy and the DMS is overwhelming. Specifically I'm talking about the Ruby named beer. The stout is boring and uninspiring. Neither beer can even hold its head. The food was bland and uninspiring as well, but the wait staff was willing to dump the beer and not charge for it. But I will say it was decorated oddly nice with plenty of things to look at, but not enough to take you mind off the poorly made product. Your  party is better off at another location. We won't be going back."
916717,"My boyfriend and I expected more from this place. We ordered an appetizer and a shawrma and had to wait for 35min. The waitress was somewhat friendly. The food was good, note we have had better food. We even we're not  asked if we wanted to drink anything. When our food arrived, we asked for forks. First the waitress took her sweet time to clean the table right next to us, while we were waiting for forks to start eating, and then brought us forks.
We ended up spending  1.5 hour there to eat three items from the menu. Our server even didn't check with us after we got our food. The wife and daughter of the restaurant owner were dressed like waitresses, but thought it was ok to sit at the table and chat with the customers, while we even did not have water to drink.
We were disappointed with the service. It was our first and last time there.
Owners: if you intend to keep your restaurant open, please provide better service to your customers, instead of yourselves sitting at the tables and acting like customers, while others wait to be served food and drinks!
If you are fine with waiting for your food forever and poor service, that's the place to go!"
2168788,"If you'd asked me a couple of years ago, I would have told you this was my favorite Happy Hour joint in Seattle.  Great food, great prices, great location, and great ambiance.  Then times got tough, and prices went up.  Times got tougher, and the portions began to shrink.  I didn't want to see one of my favs. go under, so I was willing to endure.  But now the food i half-assed at best.  Sometime better than others, but consistently inconsistent.  I'm speculating that they hired a new service manager to ""trim the fat.""  I guess if they're aiming to be more like Walmart, they're doing it right.  Sorry to say I've axed Dragongish from the list in favor of List and Barolo."
1457361,"It's very classy inside.  The employees do a great job waiting on customers.  The music is great.  The food is very tasty with small plate sizes.

I've been back and forth with this place.  They have made some great changes!  The owner is in touch with his customers.  The customer service is spot on and the owner is making changes that customers want to see.  During the week, you can listen to music at a low level and have a drink without having to pay a cover!  On the weekend there are 2 different ""bands.""  The first is low key and the second is louder.  I think they start at 9:00pm."
859433,Cute place to eat. Food was tastey. Nothing special
1330006,"After the first time trying the pizza I was apprehensive to try it again because of my issue with the roasted garlic but I am so glad I gave it another try. 
We have become a big fan of their pizza, especially ordering it thin crust and light on the sauce. Their delivery is usually around 45 minutes which is great and their cheesy garlic bread is delicious."
959995,"Coming from a very Asian community (626 in LA), PF Chang's feels like... Americanized Asian food for a more upscale type of people. The food is okay... not that authentic, but the flavors are alright. It's the price that I don't like. It's just that I can get the same food (probs better) for far cheaper elsewhere. But of course, this restaurant caters to a different type of customers.

They have good cocktails though. And the restaurant is nicer than any Chinese/other Asian places I've been to haha. But when it comes to food, I'd rather have it be super bomb and cheap in a shitty hole in the wall place, rather than mediocre food for a lot of money in a nice and classy place."
977753,"Fantastic menu loaded with fun cocktails. The wasabi grilled cheese is a thing of wonder and the tomato soup is creamy and excellent. Very friendly staff, although sometimes the service is slow."
263223,"Good pizza, not the best I've ever had, but pretty good, nice salad selection, and they have great local beers. This place gets a high rating from me because I can take my 1 and 2 year old to dinner knowing that we won't be the only other family with young children, and that most of the diners won't care that my one year old has a staring problem, and my two year old has a quiet, sit still problem. He's also in an observant yelling stage and will sometimes scream, ""look Mommy, he fat!,"" or, ""what wrong with that girl"" at the top of his lungs. Service was good, they bring little balls of dough for your kids to play with and crayons. They also have free covered parking!"
925449,"Ate hear July 11. I would give 4 stars, but I do think you need good review information to avoid the pitfalls that could cause a poor evening here. That shouldn't be the case. 
Below, the cons and pros of just about everything. My portion of the bill, 3 courses and two glasses of wine, would have totaled about $75. Would be cheaper p.p. on a date, assuming you'd share app and dessert, possibly a good value wine rather than by the glass. 

Cons: 
-Small appetizer portions for the two Ahi dishes. The calamari was ""meh"" for sure. Wouldn't order Calamari again. 
-I was the ordering guide for most of the group b/c I'd scouted reviews. I shouldn't have to do extensive research to make sure my large group gets what they pay for and doesn't get something cooked or seasoned poorly. 
-The waitress, or kitchen, was confusing about the Dungeness Crab Fettuccine. The menu says there is a light cream sauce, the waitress said it was pretty heavy. If it says light........make sure a normal waitress gal, girl next door, agrees kitchen. 
-No one cared for the rice w/their dishes. Would have preferred more veg, rather than a carb they make at home, esp. since it wasn't with asian food choices. 
-The burnt creme was not bad, but meh. The guest who ordered it shared with many. We all agreed on this. 

The Pros:
-Complimentary valet parking, plus tip of course. 
-The service and the view were perfect! When I was confused about the cream sauce the waitress went to the kitchen and returned with a small sample the chef had made lighter. Top service. Wait time was medium b/t courses, but what I'd expect for a pleasant night for our table size.
-The Halibut was fantastic. At least four people had it at our table, several of the different ways, and they gobbled it down. 
-I loved the crab fettuccine. Loads of crab and tasty. Ate half there and half around 10p.m. after late errands and a 2 mile walk. 
-Someone had the charred portobello, and another the fillet mignon, both were really happy.
-For the crab cakes, you may want to sub out the rice for something else, but the diner loved the crab cakes. 
-Salads seemed good, others got them. Table bread was surprisingly good. 
-I don't eat much chocolate. I and 4 other people got the flourless chocolate cake. Amazing! You'd think all those flavors would be overload, but not so. Dif textures also v. nice. I gave about half of mine away.....dress to fit into at location wedding and all. 
-Another guest got the berry crisp, or whatever it's called, and really liked it."
1007021,"I was brought here by a Groupon and it ended up being a nice find. A perfect place to have breakfast on a Saturday morning. The pastries are flakey and buttery, but on the dense side. The almond croissant was a winner with a good balance of filling. The portions are pretty large and prices are cheaper relative to comparable French bakeries."
835856,"LOVE me some Jimmy John's and there is one at The Landing! This was great when I was working in Renton a few weeks back because JJ is quick, friendly, and delicious! I've been to this Jimmy John's a few times and found the space to be a little small, but clean and it gets the job done! My favorite sandwich is the #11 Country Club! Yummy"
1040889,"SCOUT: Ate here a couple times throughout my stay in Spokane. High marks for what it is - a imaginative diner / bar food concept in an awesome historic hotel.  The interiors are not only appropriate, but really engaging.  It's well thought out, as is the menu.  It caters to almost any interest, while still providing the diner / bar experience - it's just that the menu has more depth than you would expect.  It's concise, but I never had an easy time deciding.  My breakfast sandwich was fantastic, and the Grinder was a very simple italian hoagie, but warm and delicious. With an obvious nod to local purveyors, they source from as nearby as possible. When I make it back, I will be back to this place.... cheers!"
860764,"Waited at Beth's for over 30 minutes. I didnt mind until, 3 groups were given a table before my party and was met with terrible service from the hostess/server. I wish  I had gotten her name. I've been to Beth's over a handful of times and thoroughly enjoyed my experiences eating delicious and hearty food as well as doodling for the walls. However since that incident I haven't been back and still associate it with the bad service that lady provided.
I hope that the owners are weary about who they hire to serve hungry patrons. One experience may definitely change a customers thoughts of a place and that definitely made an impact on me. I'm still bitter about it!!!"
840926,"This place is normally ok (not great, but ""ok"") but our last visit was terrible! The orders came out wrong, food was sloppy and wet, soggy. The ""re-do"" wasn't any better. It was made correctly but still not good. Hashbrowns are similar to a mashed potatos that are crispy on the top/bottom. Just Awful. The Waitress was awesome, wish i knew her name. She made it better as much as she could and comped my order but i left starving, hungry and unsatisfied. This place/chain has won some awards, but i think they stopped trying to be good. Its a mess."
929507,"Was awesome, quick, and delicious!"
2144312,Bottom line; best sandwich in seattle. Cuban Roast.. If you don't enjoy this sandwich then your taste is awful.
861682,"A phenomenal low-key, almost-no-seating restaurant that has never disappointed in the many years we've visited their Fremont and Ballard locations."
512990,"I love this place on a bright, sunny day, but is not great on non-grand days. The inside location is rather small and a bit cramped when you can't go outside."
973598,Staff is friendly and service was good. Food was also good. The setup of the TVs for watching games is great. Overall a good experience. Columbia City is really impressing me these days.
1038307,"Great vegan pizza! Their vegan cheese (possibly Daiya) is delicious and they are generous with it. The same goes for the toppings; they are fresh and plentiful. The service was great both times I went. It wasn't too busy midweek, so the servers were very good about checking up on us and making sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere and decor was perfect, very comfortable and inviting. They have a beer menu at each table listing all their drafts, including where they are brewed, abv, etc. This is a nice touch when trying to pick something new. Overall, one of the best vegan pizzas I've had."
2155064,"Authentic Xiao Long Bao Zi, but over-pricing."
796217,"We got there shortly after it open and it was already pretty full. However, we got seated right away and the staff was very friendly. The food was good, but a bit pricey. We loved the decor!"
2147268,"Delicious! Definitely recommended. Just keep in mind that this is a greek yogurt, not frozen yogurt or ice cream."
1016579,"Mediocre food at best

Over priced menu items

Extremely loud bar

Dated and cluttered decor

I should have taken the hint when there was only one other table occupied at the dining side of the restaurant.  No desire to return here."
1956068,"This is by far our favorite Chinese restaurant in Washington State. Even though the place looks like a small place in a strip mall area, the food and service is fantastic. The dishes are consistent and the menu includes authentic cuisine that feels familiar, yet allows for experimentation. 

This is a place we can bring our friends and family who aren't as familiar with Chinese food and walk away impressed. 

The place can get packed, but the wait is worth it."
1339052,"This is actually pretty good. The meats are of questionable quality, but the flavor is fantastic. Especially love their cilantro rice. Bomb.

I would go back again."
1118751,"Chose to eat here instead of the Seattle Fish Mkt on California because it had a better vibe to me inside & also has an unobstructed view of Alki Beach.  It is also family owned & operated business wc I prefer to support. 

Had a small bowl of clam chowder and their small fish (cod) & chips basket.  The chowder was the way I like it; thick & creamy.  This is the 3rd cup of chowder I've had on my trip to Seattle & I liked this one best.  

That's not to say that the other chowder I had at Pike Place Chowder & the Lockspot Cafe were worse; just different. Of the 3, Sunfish's was the cheapest & Pike Place the most expensive.  So, Sunfish's chowder has that going for it too.

The cod in the fish & chips was also very good.  There was a nice battered crust covering the cod, which was nice & flaky.  The small order supposedly only has 1pc of cod in it, but I got 2; guess it depends on the size or weight. 

They also offer 3 different types of malt vinegar: the standard type & 2 infused versions -- garlic only & garlic & peppers.  I preferred the garlic & pepper version.

The only low point were the fries wc were slightly burnt. The Lockspot still has the BEST fries based on my limited sampling of restaurants in the area so far.

If I were in the area longer, I'd probably become a fan but for now I can say it's an ok place to go for chowder & some fish & chips."
914626,"How have I yet to review the Adriatic Grill? 

Hands down, the restaurant I take all my out of town friends and family. I suggest it to anyone looking for a great meal, and whenever I need a bit of heaven, I come to the Adriatic. 

Staff friendliness is obviously mandatory. The owners make a point to treat everyone like family that comes through the door. 

What's good to eat? Anything that they'll make for you will be worthwhile. 

Also, one of the best patios in the city."
2197165,"We would never go to this restaurant again, nor would we recommend this restaurant to anybody.  Awful.

Went tonight for Thanksgiving. Menu looked wonderful, execution was horrible.  Service was middle of the road.  The waitress was pleasant but there were really long lulls where we didn't see her.

Started with the truffle fries.  They were really good,

Husband had the Boka salad with bacon and tart cherries which was ok,  the food went way south from there.  They brought out some store bought rolls at some point that were stale and inedible.  Nice touch. Not.

My son had the rabbit with a mole sauce, I had duck confit and my husband had pork belly and ALL of the dishes had basically the same brown, thick, cloyingly sweet sauce.  Like it came from a communal pot and they just used different dishes and proteins.  The duck confit was horrible.  No duck leg, just some shredded pieces of what could have been duck, with the thick brown sauce, layered with bisquick pancakes and a sprinkling of what could have been cilantro. 

The rabbit was served in a larger plate with the same
 sauce and some chunks of sweet potato,  the pork belly had the same sauce but thinned with a little bit of broth.  who do you think you are fooling BOKA?  No salt or flavor other than sugar in anything.

Who is the chef- Augustus Gloop?

I know there aren't a lot of restaurants open on thanksgiving but we usually go out and do ok.  Would never go back to this place.

Wretched experience."
1079640,"I used to love Anthony's. When asked a great upscale restaurant in the Tricities, this is where I would have suggested going... but lately it seems like their quality is hit or miss. Sometimes their food is awesome and the service is great, sometimes its not. We went for Valentines day and were very disappointed. We ordered crab cakes (the best things ever tasted, usually) and they had shells in them. My husband ordered their yellowfin tuna rare, but it actually came cold. Sent it back for just a little longer cook time and then it came back rubber. I had steak and prawns, which was okay, but not amazing. We won't be going back for a while."
1054913,Ugh. Food was NOT GOOD. Pricy for tasteless omelets. Large portions if that's your thing.
853963,"They should call it ""All You Can Eat Rice"" for $25.99
Never again."
831881,"I really like how the Bremerton Grill is located Ã¼ber convenient to the waterfront, ferry terminal and waterfront. 

The servers here are expedient and friendly. They understand that you may need to take off to catch your ferry.

There are bunches of healthy choices for you here like the tuna lettuce wraps, the seafood chowder and maybe not-so-healthy, yet delicious hot wings.

Bremerton Grill also has several good regional micro beers from great breweries like Diamond Knot and American Brewing."
2153434,"Great happy hour!  Loved the March specialty drink...I think it was called a Ginger Fizz...made with ginger liqueur, lemon juice, cherry bitters and prosecco. Delish!  A bit overpriced for happy hour but I loved it.  Also had the burger...perfection.  Bring your appetite, or she with a friend, cuz it's big but fabulous."
1948694,"Ok food, good service. For this restaurant I expected better. Was a large group so maybe that threw them off. Fortunately there was plenty of good Washington wine."
907714,"Very pleased with our experience at Moshi Moshi last night. We were a group of five, two of whom don't eat sushi. The space is lovely and spare. I really liked the lit cherry blossoms on the metal tree in the centre of the room.

I'm not a fan of raw fish, but enjoy other types of Japanese food. I had the teriyaki salmon combination, which was delicious. It came with a seaweed sunomono salad, rice, a roll, and miso soup. The sunomono was the only disappointing part of the meal--the cucumbers hadn't been thoroughly tossed in the vinegar dressing and had their peel, which was slightly bitter. Otherwise, every element was quite tasty.

My friends enjoyed their various nigiri and special rolls and they indulged in the cookie dough-ice cream roll dessert. Barely a bite of that was left, so it must have been delicious. 

Service was very friendly and thoughtful. We did use a http://Restaurant.com certificate and that sometimes changes the style of service. Not here--our server was courteous, friendly and thorough."
959986,"This place has the best manager ever. Our soup came out with raw wonton YUCK,

The server came back with another one lickity split.

Another one bites the dust.... raw again.

My sister and I had wine so we didn't really care. I was up visiting from San Diego and was happy to be back in Seattle.

In an instant, the manager came around and apologized. We told him it was ok.
He came back with two cards for appetizers for next time. 
Then he took the soup off of our bill of course.

I love the environment, service everything!!"
1774622,"Four of us came together to dine and nourish ourselves.  We sampled and shared the appetizers We had a delicious home made mozzarella with a Yakima cherry reduction, a luscious poached tuna that was sensational, all the appetizers were executed to tantalite the palette. The halibut was melt in the mouth served on flavorful stated greens in combination with seasoned sautÃ©ed mushrooms that was fantastic. Our server's concern and delivery of food and beverages was spot on in timing and attention to our needs. The music was a delightful mix and ambiance was relaxed  and refined  allowing  us to share each other's conversation  and company"
2797183,"Here is my honest review:

Tensing MoMo was Delicious. Spinach MoMo was good as well. Himalayan Curry was very tasty, not happy with battered Fish (not Himalayan style). 
Overall, great place for Nepalese food."
818654,"We have been going to the Black Angus for Decades...when it belonged to Stuart Anderson!  We have always enjoyed it. But this last weekend was an exception. My husband was celebrating his birthday with a generous free birthday dinner. However, both our steaks were overcooked, and dry. My husband ordered asparagus and it was also very over cooked. My au gratin potatoes were very dry. Disappointing! What was not disappointing though, was our server. She was wonderful. Very sweet, very nice. Heres hoping the cook was really off last Sunday and it isnt like this all the time!"
1124223,"Ivar's has solid seafood and we enjoyed the deals during Happy Hour.  The fish and chips, fried prawns and calamari were al very good.  There was a long wait for a table so we ate in the bar section which wasn't any noisier than the restaurant.  Service was alright.  If you're looking for something to eat in the area, I would recommend it."
1933326,One word..... Moonraker!
1092696,"I've only been here once. It was the servers 2nd day- so she didn't know a lot about the menu. She kept pushing stuff that I wasn't interested in. My friend & I ordered, the food was pretty good, but not memorable, and a bit pricey. I wanted to try their spring rolls- but when the server told me it was $6 for two rolls- I passed. It's a really cute place on Rainier, and I'm definitely gonna try it again because of it's location in proximity to where I visit in Seattle, hoping that it will be better next time!"
886182,"The best pad thai I've ever had. Cooking time a little long, but so worth it. Their chili sauce comes on the side and is so good!"
1158816,"Service was not very attentive, as I had many times where I'd go for 20 minutes at a time with no drink or no one coming around to check on us. I ordered a sirloin with mashed potatoes. The steak was quite undercooked but still delicious. There is a good selection of whiskeys and a few good local brews. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing which was probably the saving grace for this restaurant. Not the best, but still a great place for friends and drinks."
1016087,"My wife and I USED to like this place. It was relatively new, intimate setting and a decent outdoor area.

We have been a total of 4 times to Laura's Bayview and each time was worse than the next. I believe describing our latest and last ever visit will help people decide if venturing here is a good idea.

Upon entering LB on 8/30/12 at approximately 7:40 it actually seemed busy which is nice to see. We took a seat on the outdoor deck area and waited for service, about 5 minutes after taking seats we were acknowledged and our drink orders were taken and menus were en route. We noticed another pair of diners and a commotion at the corner of the outdoor deck, apparently he sat a rat. After the animal disappeared and tensions calmed everything went back to normal. After dinner orders were taken the rat made a second appearance and apparently scurried off before being apprehended. The owner or manager(red haired lady) had taken notice and about the only thing she was able to do was close the door and complain about the situation.

After about 30-35 minutes we decided dining outside with the animals was no longer okay we took a seat at one of the inside tables. It took much convincing of my wife that we should stay and just get our meals and leave as it was Friday night and we would just be waiting somewhere else. It took nearly 45 minutes for my cup of soup and my wife's caesar salad to come to our table. I know kitchens can get busy and orders can be late, but there was a grand total of maybe 12 people in the restaurant, I would expect the food to come out quicker. When the soup and salad came to our table, the soup was pleasant and my wife described the caesar salad as ""average.""

The night was winding down and there weren't many people left in the restaurant at this point. After our soup and salad were taken from our table, it took an additional 30 minutes to receive our entrees. (Chicken Parm, Steak cooked medium) I enjoyed my chicken parmesan as I always do at LB, Good sized chicken breast which is moist and the breading is crispy. The steak on the other hand was a little undercooked (we didn't complain at this point and just wanted to leave) but the bigger crime is that it was criminally under seasoned if it was at all. After making quick work of our dinner we received the bill and I was charged an extra $1 for choosing pasta to pair with my chicken parmesan which I was not made aware of. I would have not had any problem what so ever with it had I been made aware, but just trying to end a frustrating night we paid and left closing the door on LB never coming back.

TL;DR Decent food, stay away because of rats"
2162606,"Just thinking about this place makes me wish I was there! My cousin was visiting from out of state so a friend and I showed him around Pike Place. My friend told me that there was a really good clam chowder place so we decided to check it out. We shared the 4 cup chowder. We basically got to choose any 4 types. Each one was amazingly good but my all time would have to be the Southwest chicken and corn. It tastes just like the original clam chowder except it's chicken. I love corn as well so this combination was perfect. Another delicious one is the Smoked salmon chowder.

Anyway, the line is always long but seemingly enough, it moves pretty quick! The only issue is finding a place to sit. Eventually you'll end up finding a spot though!"
962891,went there once. place stated that it closes at 10:30. came in 10:20 and the waitress lady didnt let me eat. just walked off.
2155137,"Awesome Southwest food and drinks! The favorites to eat: Chili Relleno, Chimayo Enchiladas, Green Enchiladas. The favorites drink: Patron Agave Margarita. One thing I will say is when its busy prepare to wait. Never been disappointed."
1699493,"There was an enormous assortment of booze to pick from but the bartender that we had was just rude and curt.  I would not recommend this place unless you're planning on a sit down meal, hopefully the servers will be nicer.  Saving grace was that the drinks he made were delicious!"
1200439,Wonderful seafood and delicious local brew choices! The staff was very pleasant and the food served very prompt. Located right in the Anacortes Harbor and has a beautiful view of the water and boats in the marina. During the week they have an affordable happy hour and sunset dinner menu. I love this place and have returned multiple times.
2542626,"Let's see...fried chicken, biscuits, and gravy. What's not to like? The food here is delicious with a lot of different options and twists on the same concept.

This Tom Douglas restaurant is always hopping with people at lunch time and can get pretty packed.  I suggest calling ahead if you can to save some time in line.

But the most important thing when it comes to a lunch establishment is the bang-for-your-buck factor.  Serious Biscuit does fairly well with about $10 getting you a medium size portion that is just filling enough. If you're looking for quantity over quality, this may not be the place to hit up. But still it's a delicious meal for ten dollars."
890823,"Awesome beer, which almost goes without saying. The frog legs taste ok, but it was really our waitress Dawn who made the experience. If at all possible to sit in her section, you won't be disappointed. She's maybe the sweetest person I've met."
1708362,"Food is avg.  Service is consistently terrible.   I live very close and purposely try to avoid this place at all costs.  In all fairness, all of my trips have been to the alehouse side of the place."
1119632,"Interesting menu, but like a few others, we, too, were terribly disappointed. I know some call it Korean Fusion, but as a Korean person and a bit of a Korean food purist, I wouldn't call it Korean Fusion. It's more like Asian Fusion. 

We had the pork belly pancake. I would liken this to bin deh dduk--a Korean soy bean pancake. It was pretty good, but for one at $10, that is really pricey. Interesting selection of 4 sauces--3 that were fairly Korean (especially the two made of red Korean chili paste) and one that was a fish sauce, which is not Korean. WE don't use fish sauce. 

We also had the pot stickers. The skin was odd to us--orange. Too crispy on one side and soggy on the other. 

We ordered both of the noodle dishes. First of all dan dan noodles (pronounced Ddahn Ddahn) were way way too star-anisey (strong Chinese spice). They put a peanut crackle on the top, which we asked for on the side since my friend is allergic to peanuts. Thank God, because the dish was already too star-anisey and the peanut crackle would have killed it. 
The other noodle dish was the crab noodles. That was our favorite dish, but unfortunately the noodles were not cooked well. There were clumps stuck together, under cooked and then others that were a little too well done. Sad. 

They had an assortment of rice dishes, which I think were inspired by bi bim bop (mixed rice). The rice is on the bottom of a bowl with various meats and greens atop the rice. You're supposed to mix and eat. Problem is, the bowls they served these dishes in were way too small so there's no way to mix them. It was funny to watch the folks trying to eat the rice dishes without knowing that you're supposed to mix it. 

The decor is cool, you can watch the chefs cooking. Overall, it's a was disappointing. To make it worse, the server had zero personality."
796129,"Had one bad wine experience here. Ordered the by the glass cab franc and it tasted nasty. They brought out another wine for us and didn't charge us, so I feel like they made up for it, but I think they should not serve bad wine. My poor husband tried to drink it, but even he gave up after a few brave attempts. 
The bread was delicious, the butter nice and chilled (not all mushy like we experienced at some other french restaurant in the area) and the selection of cured meats that I tried was also good.  I like the atmosphere-you almost feel like you are in another country in this quaint cafe."
687952,"I came here for brunch last Saturday.  The restaurant wasn't extremely busy, but I still had to wait quite a while to get served.  I ordered eggs benedict, florentine style.  Usually when I order this, the spinach is saute'ed or steamed.  But here, it was just served raw.  Weird.  The hollandaise sauce was good, though.  

Overall, it was overpriced for the quality.  ($17 for coffee and eggs benedict, with tip.) 					Show owner comment »"
1761850,"The good:

Insalata di spinaci - The spinach salad was good, dressing was a little tart.  But of course, the bacon compensated for that.  I'd probably choose a different salad next round.

Rigatoni Salsiccia - extra creamy rigatoni with Italian sausage.  Easily shareable for two.

Prosciutto Crudo pizza: I usually avoid thin pizzas, but I just couldn't do it here!  While folding pizza is a foreign thing to me (by choice), I picked up the trait quickly here.  The pizza was incredible. Slightly ""burnt"" crust, super thin prosciutto mounds on the pizza... delicious!  Very impressed. 

The two entrees above could easily be shared with three people, unless you're stingy like me and want leftovers.

Very attentive servers and I most especially loved the modern-day violinist that had a contagious smile!  

Oh also - Montepulciano and Sangiovese wines here were stellar!

I think if the prices were dropped by just two dollars per entree, this place would get five stars for me! Also, the pasta dish was sparing on the sausage which was a little sad. The cost is a little high (can't believe I'm typing that!). It is a more intimate restaurant for sure, but you can come here with friends without feeling like you should have brought a date instead."
1329168,"This place is simply fantastic! My father has attended this restaurant weekly for over a year, and finally I went along! 
The staff here are very delightful; never do they crowd you or abandon you. Anything you could possibly need is taken care of in a timely non overbearing manner! They are all dressed impeccably, and extremely classy.
Our food was extremely delicious; we ordered a pizza, chicken under a brick and a chicken salad! I will admit I packed my pizza to go because I was very content eating my fathers chicken dish! They were both however, very yummy and my mother loved her salad!
Now for dessert! I wanted to marry the chef after eating my chocolate cake, it was to die for! I am one picky chocolate cake consumer and it took first place! The crÃ¨me Brule is also very good; though I would never abandon my chocolate cake! 
So go ahead, give this place a shot!"
1942624,"Have been here before and always Love it.  This time service was a little slow, and possibly because of the season (October) there was not much seafood on the menu.   And really no 'fresh' seafood.  
Still good, and I highly recommend."
808962,"Great food, large portions, attentive service, at great prices....

How can it get anything but 5 stars?

Food was great, bacon is cooked how you like it (nice touch), and I couldn't come close to finishing my meal"
2597042,"Yesssssss I love love this place. Had some wonderful memories in Seattle, absolutely love that city. I came here on a date with my boyfriend (when we came here, he was still trying to woo me ;) LOL), and we had their brunch menu. I think it was prix fixe? Well, it came with appetizer, entree, and dessert for a certain price. It was pretty expensive... I remember that.

But worth it. The food was BOMB. And it should be, when you're up in the Space Needle circling around seeing the whole city from an awesome high view. That was a good day.

I had the salad, my bf had the clam chowder. Both delicious, finished those dishes fast. The soup was creamy, flavorful, and the chip on top added a delicious crisp to it. The salad... really good for a Caesar Salad. Their dressing stood out, the lettuce fresh and crisp, and overall just delicious. Love that sh**. Then main course came... I had the prime rib, while the bf had rib eye steak I think. BOTH SO GOOD. I love my meats, and my prime rib was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly - medium and full of love. It had some fatty pieces... which I like. MMM. I was super full by dessert, but we had the tiramisu and cheesecake. Both delicious.

LOVED IT ALL! Plus had some good memories here so that added to my love of this place."
2155247,"My boyfriend is a foodie and loved the greasy spoon pies in Australia so this was going to be a challenging sell. I had come here several times before for the wonderful food but mainly for my second favorite hard to find brew which is on tap here. Both of our pies were AMAZING and the potato fries were banging. Super thick and crispy but what really sold me was not my foodie-boyfriend and taster of the original thing's endorsement but that when we went I realized that they actually had my first favorite brew on tap which is also super hard to find.

If I had the money, I would scratch my kitchen and everything it in to just eat here everyday."
1919689,Been here a few times. Nice place. It is pretty big with a long bar..Not crowded at all at weekdays. They have there own beers but also have Carona and maybe some other beers... Overall all nice place..
1081866,"I wanted to write an update because I've been back to Fado since my last 2-star posting. To sum it up real quick, I didn't have the greatest experience and therefore considered not going back. But I wanted to be fair and let everyone know that Fado made a very sincere effort in winning back my seal of approval, and they got it.

This past experience at Fado was a very positive one, as Fado had assured me it would be. I came with about 10 coworkers to celebrate one of their birthdays, and Fado was generous enough to comp a round of drinks and provide some food platters on the house to make up for last time. The food platters had like chicken strips, quesadillas, and a kind of pita bread thing paired with cheese dip. YUM.

The staff at Fado that night was very attentive and we were served by one of their senior staff members. I want to say her name MIGHT have been Katie, but honestly I totally suck with names. She was quite easy on the eyes, if that helps.

Anyway, our server helped make our night a good one. She was friendly without being fake, she listened to all of our drink orders and checked in on how we were doing regularly even though I know she was busy. Overall, we had a very solid experience and I will once again recommend Fado to anybody in the downtown Seattle area looking for a chill venue with stiff pours and a good vibe.

Cheers, Fado. We'll see you again sometime soon."
1289380,"Stumbled this place while browsing the market and didn't know it was one of the best places to eat (after checking on the yelp & Food Network). We ordered the clam chowder, fish & chips and crab roll.
Clam chowder -  chucks of clam and bacon with superb thickness soup.It's one of the best chowder we had. Excellent! Wished ordered the bowl instead of a cup only :)
Crab roll - Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! :)
Fish & Chips - it's moderate 

We sat on the 1st floor because it's close to the fountain drink. Next time we'll sit upstairs for view."
1914422,"The best Japanese restaurant I've been to, hands down. The specials on the back wall are the best, (the owner lady is the best person to ask for menu recommendations, she knows seafood down to which seasons are the best for which fish, and is very friendly) basically, anything she recommends, is good."
1100718,"If it wasn't for the location, this place would really struggle. The wait staff is nice, but they almost always mess up the order. The food is average at best (fairly bland and often luke warm). I would recommend Bluwater primarily as a place to have a drink and watch a game in the bar area or have the toll house cookie dessert (which is really good)."
2161467,"This place gets worst every time I go here. Same goes with a friend  and an elderly couple that I recommend to go there. They both experienced the same exact service that I've went through at 3 different times. The decor and seating is decent. There is usual wait times as the space is limited. The food is decent but very small portions for a hefty price. In the middle of all 3 of our dinners, we were not asked once or twice, many times by the waiters/waitress if we were done. Clearly, they are blind as we were still working on our plates and still chewing with our jaws. After they boxed up and non stop trying to tidy the table we asked if we are ready for the bill. COME ON LEAVE YOUR CUSTOMERS ALONE! I might just not go there for food anymore."
269479,"To be entirely honest, I wavered a little on this review. Fine dining calls for high expectations, and dinner at a place like this needs to be pretty close to perfect to earn the top review for me. Suffice to say, my wife took me out for my birthday dinner here and it was close to perfect, although not all the way there. We sat out on the patio - lovely space, although it could use some updating - and were immediately treated to great service. Knowledgable waiter, good recommendations, not too intrusive, good all around. Starting with cocktails was a great choice. The perfect manhattan lived up to its name (this kind of drink really comes down to precision and quality ingredients, and both were evident). My wife's drink (can't remember the name) was good, too.

For the dinner service itself, we ordered a number of dishes, ranging from awesome (crudo) to very good (duck). Portion sizes were small, as is typical for this kind of place, so be forewarned. One of the weak spots was the delay between starters and entrees, inducing me to shell out for extra bread service, which ended up coming out with our entrees anyways. Dessert, however, made up for any doubts. I don't even know what we ordered, but it was amazing. Don't worry, pastry/dessert chef at Crush, whatever it was you made was awesome. As were pre-dessert and apres-dessert. Wins all around."
875608,High end fancy American - delicious small plates. Good for a nice date or for dinner with out of towners from New York you are looking to impress!
1003707,"For what it is and where it's located, it's not bad - though a tad on the pricey side, even for a tourist-trap-zone.

The soda bread was, in fact, awesome.

The Bailey's-soaked steak was, in fact, really weird.  Irish Teriyaki?  Would not get again.

The Guinness Stew was unremarkable.

The bread was good. The beer was good. :)

Nice atmosphere."
2163021,"Decent enough place. You're basically paying for the decor since the food is pretty much on par with other establishments of this variety in Seattle. They do make a decent cocktail at night though.
The score i'm giving now is purely on the breakfast/lunch time department. DO NOT get the baked eggs.
It was like taking a fatty dip into a Dennys skillet. Everything was a jumbled mess, greasy, and soggy. 
It arrived in a small skillet and that was it (i would've definitely raised this review by one star if the meal had come with a biscuit or some sort of carb to soak/mellow everything out). The eggs were just cracked into the mess so after baking, the egg yolks were one solid, dry, chunk. And there was no flavor other than grease and salt.
The oatmeal my gf had was better.
Come for the oatmeal assuming you can get more nuts than she got on hers.
Overall, it was frustrating to go and dine in a place only to walk out equally as frustrated except $20 short."
1296215,"First time here was for Seattle Restaurant Week. Had the chowder, smokes salmon salad, and the cake for dessert. LOVED it and had good service. My boyfriend ordered from the HH menu and got the appetizer tower. Really good food on the happy hour menu for a great deal.

Came back a second time - this time for the late happy hour. Tried other things on the menu - crab cakes: two thumbs up and pulled pork nachos! BUT this time, had the worst waitress ever. Did not say a single word during service. When she was pouring water to refill my boyfriend's cup, she squeezed in behind him and started pouring w/o saying ""excuse me"" or anything of that sort. Beginning of service I had their paper coaster in my hands and when she brought the glasses of water out, she just grabbed it out of my hand without saying a word. We were having a great night until dinner and it ruined our experience at this restaurant. A little more hesitant to go back now but we live right in the Landing area so will probably try it again and hopefully not have the same gal wait our table.

People need to understand - crappy service makes me not want to sit in the restaurant and continue eating my food."
2145170,So good! The breakfast happy hour made me soil myself. Super nice staff. Little pricey...
1775689,"We had the tasting menu.  The dishes were quite tasty, but the sushi itself was a bit of a disappointment.  Several pieces had wasabi loaded onto them to a degree that left both me and my wife gasping more than once.

Wasabi is an accent; good sushi doesn't need, and shouldn't have, tons of it.  Based on the other dishes, this place would be a tossup between three and four stars, but the wasabi overload lands this place squarely in the three star camp."
1034333,"Always a reliable and friendly dinner! I love the fajitas, with homemade tortillas. Everything we've ordered here is always fresh and fast! The servers are always courteous and attentive. Eating here is always one of the dining out options, no matter what day if the week."
1103292,"got to seattle craving for some good porridge...stumbled upon this place while Yelping the area, we waited for about 20 min for a table. This place is so small and crowded. Hands down for the porridge, ordered the porridge with pumpkin, delicious! We also tried their wonton noodle soup, noodles were al dente, wonton was meaty and tasty. Oh and the soup, wow.....you can actually taste the shrimp that was cooked in the soup. Felt very satisfying afterwards and not thirsty at all....what means....no MSG!"
1448135,"Perfect food
Can't dream to be better
Scallops and rabbit!!!!!!1
So tender"
122635,"The Capital Grille never disappoints every time I come here for Restaurant Week. I've always loved the beautiful atmosphere and the amazing food and service that they consistently provide. The complimentary valet parking is really helpful since parking in downtown Seattle is a pain...especially if it's raining!

For appetizers I had the field greens salad which was ginormous, and my boyfriend had the clam chowder. The salad was refreshing and the chowder was rich and flavorful. We were both starving and I was happy that they provided us a variety of different breads to nibble on while we were waiting for our food. I love bread!

The 14 oz Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry-Aged Sirloin has to be one of the most amazing steaks I had. The shallot butter sauce gave it lots of flavor and I really enjoyed their mashed potatoes. I was in heavenly bliss as I devoured each bite. Before I knew it, it was already time for dessert. I had their creme brulee which was amazing and he had the fruit sorbet. I personally liked the creme brulee more since it was a little more light and not as sweet as the sorbet.

We were stuffed after our meal and could barely move! Service was excellent and our waitress checked up on us at just the right times. A lot of nice places tend to serve smaller portions especially during Restaurant Week but Capital Grille is the exception. If you are hungry or ravenous, this place is definitely worth it. And who doesn't like good steak??"
787135,"I had the tasting menu/ 4 course prix fix.  The restaurant's food was exceptional - almost every small plate set on our table was impressive.  There were a couple of duds- the peas/mint/ricotta was a little ho hum.  Fried oysters were really well done, but they were still just fried oysters...kind of a shame when I could taste that they were good enough to eat raw!  The seafood was stellar, as good as Olive and Anchovy.
So WHY would I knock two stars off?  What kind of awful snob am I?

Unfortunately, there were a lot of irritating things about the experience.  I take no issue with paying a high price for food, but I have very high expectations for the quality of food and service at this price point.

We called a WEEK in advance for reservations, and the ONLY time they'd have us on Saturday was at 10:15PM.  When we showed up a little early(because we were starved), the place was mostly empty.  I'm thinking this was done to manufacture demand or exclusivity.  It worked on me the first time, but it's a tired tactic at Stowell's restaurants and I'm not sure I'll tolerate it again.

I have never complained about, or even noticed, music in a restaurant, but it was such garbage at this place that I felt I might be in a Gilmore girls episode or something.  It was an awful melange of John Mayer and reasonable facsimiles thereof.  And it was LOUD.  How much can I really enjoy ANYTHING while someone is forcing me to listen to ""Hey Soul Sister"" at 11:30PM?  If I wanted to listen to that tripe I'd have gone to Olive Garden.  This food, the decor, the neighborhood, was too good for this music.  If they were trying to be ""exclusive"", they failed miserably with a mainstream playlist directed at 12 year old girls.

Also, the building shares a bathroom with the other businesses in it.  This means that bathroom looks like a bomb went off, especially at midnight when they finally dropped off the last course! (you'll be visiting the bathroom- our tasting menu took nearly 3 hours!)
 I'd put up with that at a brew pub where I just paid $15/head.  But at $45/head before drinks, that offends me."
858893,"The place is now CLOSED!

I was told by the guy next door that the owner just returned to Korea. What a wasted 20-min trip to check it out :("
1898994,The best part about this place is that you can design your lunch. The noodle soup bowls are a huge portion for a good price at lunch. No flare but a good hearty meal.
2151047,I love this place the curry is insane! Best curry in Wallingford! Just wish they didn't close between lunch and dinner!
792866,"I come here way too much.

I get everything, and everything is good. My favorite is the chicken katsu, but I usually get the daily or chef special.  For about $8, your going to get a ton of food, mainly meat, so you're not getting ripped off getting full on rice and mac salad. 

The L&L girls are my favorite, they're so sweet!"
689506,"I love this little cafÃ© in Kent.  My bro and his family brought us here this past weekend for brunch.  

The coffee was good, the food was even better!  My hubby had the Dungeness Crab and Asparagus omelet, while I had the Smoked Salmon omelet.  Both were delish.  I couldn't finish my portion, so I took it home.  But even a day later, it was still yummy!"
855228,"The Market Theater Gum Wall first began around 1993 when patrons from the theater started sticking their gum on the wall to adhere coins to it. Efforts were made to scrape the gum away, but theater workers finally gave up when officials from the Pike Place Market declared it a tourist attraction in 1999.

I hadn't even heard of it, having just returned to WA recently, until one of my friends came to visit me from Texas. She had done some research on the area and said she wanted to see it. As we approached, we jammed a bunch of gum into our mouths and started chewing. We weren't prepared when we beheld the great gum wall for the first time. And we just couldn't bring ourselves to actually touch the wall by adding our gum to it. Looking back at the pictures now, I see us pretending to do it, but our faces were all screwed up in nauseated disgust. Having visited the wall a few times now, I still can't get past the ""yuck factor.""

It's no big surprise to find It has another claim to fame... it was named the 2nd ""germiest tourist attraction"" in 2009, second only to the Blarney Stone. Believe it or not, there's actually another of its kind in San Luis Obispo, CA called Bubblegum Alley that was started around the 1960's."
1132435,This place is AMAZING everything about it to the drinks to the dessert i had it last week i have gone back 3 times since them awesome military discount
1147502,"Our experience was a mixed bag. The heat was blasting from the vents on the walls, so the front door was open. It meant that we were both hot and cold--an odd sensation. (Maybe the landlord controls the heat? Don't know, but it was not pleasant.) They also seemed to be understaffed, so the evening was oddly paced. The food was tasty, but they were out of a number of dishes. The prices seemed fair for most things. This was my second visit (I was last there a few years ago on another trip to Seattle), and I might give it another shot if I was in the mood for tapas."
948596,"Waaayyy overpriced!  We paid $600 for a table of four (and I was not happy to hear, after the fact, we could have saved 20% if we bought our tickets thru Costco). Somehow, we managed to get a bill at the end of the night for another $240!  Beware of the overpriced drinks and upgrades!  

It simply wasn't as impressive as it has been in the years past."
905260,"I'm on the fence with a four star review.

The pizza is good.  Very chewy.  Sometimes you're in the mood for a thicker crust.  The salad was delicious.  

We went for the happy hour special. 

Sure, we split a salad and each had personal pizzas and had two rounds each (maybe hubby had a third).  But I do know we left with a bill just shy of $70.  So...it's good, but not quite sure it was $70 good.  

We sat at the bar and service was fine."
81876,"So I've been here twice now, and I'm definitely a fan. There is something out being able to eat and consume alcohol in a comfy chair with your friends that makes the movie-going experience that much better. Not to mention the fact that the theaters themselves are quite small, so you're only in the room with maybe 30 other people.

I would caution you against sitting in the first 4-5 rows, though -- seriously, it's almost impossible to see the screen. The food is kind of ""Meh"" but, c'mon its being made in a movie theater. Order some sliders and a beer, sit back and relax, and watch Zac Efron's face in 20x its normal size. What could be better!?

Pro Tip: Show up a little early and order a pitcher at the bar in the lobby, that way you have drinks while you're in the theater waiting for the film to start."
922520,"My husband and I visited this week, to celebrate our anniversary. We have been here a few times before, and like to save this place for our Special Occasions. The food did NOT disappoint. We split the raw oysters for an appetizer. They were slightly fishy, but...hey. It's raw seafood. I liked it. 

For our main course, my husband had the duck hash and I had the short rib locro. Both were really good, but the duck was the best I've EVER had. Spice rubbed duck breast, seared, served over duck leg confit and cauliflower. My husband let me have the tips of both pieces of breast, because he knows it's my favorite, but he polished off the rest of his dinner by himself with NO problem. 

My locro was full of turnips, tender pork, and hominy. There was plenty to fill me up, and take home enough for lunch the next day. 

We ordered the roast cauliflower with aged vermont cheddar as a side. It was tasty, no surprise there. 

Thanks for another great visit! We will be back, for sure. Flat Iron Grill is the best place to spend a special occasion in Issaquah!"
1910487,"Huge fan of this restaurant setup.  Deli meets restaurant.  Love it.  Come in order the steak and frites get a beer and leave with some delicious meats for your fridge.  

We need more business / delis in our life."
2471794,"Great food, at reasonable prices. Service is always on this owners mind and she knows that industry well. Wonderful wine selection . Great atmosphere!!!! Come get your smash"
878650,"I feel like a horrible person, but I was just very disappointed by the chowder here. 
Waiting in the long line, looking around watching people enjoy the chowder and seeing all the ""1st Place Chowder"" awards this place has won, I was expecting the best chowder that I've ever had in my life.

Being from the Bay Area, where we love our chowder, I make it a point to always try the chowder in all the different marine citys that serve them.

For me, the Pike Place Chowder was anticlimactic.

To be sure to try their best chowders, since they have so many different flavors, I ordered the sampler, and had their top 4 chowder sellers: New England Clam Chowder, Salmon Clam chowder, Manhattan Style Clam Chowder and the Seafood Bisque. All had a very distinct taste, but none were so good that I had to have more. 
I felt that the chowders were very watery and not as thick. They just didn't have the 'Mmmm' flavor. 

I think the only plus is that they do have many different kinds of chowders available. I still need to try the rest of the flavors, but if the top 4 didn't wow me, I don't high hopes for the rest. 

The Best Chowder I've ever had will still be at The Fish Hopper in Monterey, Ca."
1948890,Found this place through yelp. With great reviews that patrons have rated how can we not celebrate our good friends birthday Here. Lets start with the CONS: This place is extremely dark. Bring a flashlight. It was hard to read the menu. Believe it or not but i used the light on my camera phone to see the menu. Our wait time here has taken pretty long. With our party size we could understand the wait time. Anticipating a mind blowing dinner we all (12 of us) were unsatisfied. Don't care for the portion size and money is not an issue but everything was SALTY. Well our appetizers where on point but the main dishes were salty. 12 dishes extremely salty. My brother order a steak and was the first to complain so He was offered a new steak and when it came out there was no flavor. It goes to show how incompetent the chefs are. We are pretty sure they were mad and said salty! fine lets see if they like it with no salt then. Probably.  My brother then asked for the pork chop instead. The server said the chef said it was saltier than the steak. Wow! What a sad birthday dinner. $800 down the drain. Not all was bad.The servers are extremely attentive and pleasant but with that alone couldnt hold the wieght up for 6/7. We shall never step foot in here again.
1038274,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner one night around 8:55 or so thinking they closed at 10. I was mistaken (they closed at 9) but they happily seated us anyways. 
I had the Lad Na and my boyfriend had the Pad See Ew and they were fine with replacing the broccoli in his dish with bean sprouts. The food tasted absolutely delicious and I burned my tongue on the broth because I was so eager! The meat was cooked perfectly; I usually find places cook beef until it's very tough. The food tasted almost as good the next day as well (minus the sticky rice that got dried out in the fridge overnight). The prices were great for how tasty it was and how much they give you.

This is definitely our new favorite place."
966824,"Medium food, Medium price, a lot of variety makes for a good buffet.

There must be a half-a-hundred Pan-Asian choices available from miso soup to chicken feet to green tea mousse.  All sitting in their little chafing dishes and containers just waiting for the grazing hordes.  And a chocolate fountain waiting for the kids.  With marshmallows!

The choices overwhelm. But all of the small, tasty bites I sampled were respectably fresh and flavorful, with some even aspiring higher.  I wouldn't give anything a culinary award, but many items were quite good. Anything with a shell ended up at the top of the list: the green mussels in the spicy sauce, the scallops with garlic and noodles, the crab legs both snow and Dungeness, and the raw oysters.

The selections are grouped roughly by cuisine - salads and sushi/sashmi at the front, desserts hiding behind, a steam table, and various stir frys, cooked and fried items stretching in a long row ending with the soups and crepe station.

My wife vouches for the fried shrimp, and the fruit at the fountain station.  Other bites that impressed me were the chicken feet (!), the shrimp dumpling, the BBQ duck, and the chocolate mousse.  I even snuck a ""french fried"" (sic)!  (I know, not on the diet plan.  But c'mon, it's a buffet, the diet plan was abandoned along with all hope when we passed the portal.) 

The sushi did not fare as well as the cooked items, at least on the night we were there.  The turnover seemed slow, so the small sushi bites dried out quickly.  The sashmi was plated on little cucumber rounds which may look attractive but flavored the fish with cucumber notes I didn't enjoy.  Some of the shelled items could use a little prep work - scallops and oysters were still attached to the shell, which does help their provenance, but makes them harder to pry loose when you want to eat them.  Crab legs could be pre-cracked. I didn't see any cracking implements available, but my caveman instincts sufficed.  Desserts, aside from the fountain and the mousse, were not worth the calories.

The Saturday night price seemed a little steep, so lunch might well be the meal of choice here, if you have time and much mid-day hunger.  Or seek out a weeknight coupon."
1925202,"Love this place.  Here today for a business lunch and had the best mussels with saffron cream.  Great views, great service... Will be back next month with wife for a special dinner!"
817394,"The bloody is where I will start.  Good g-d almighty that was a strong bloody!  But I was happy lol.  The in house beef jerky with pickled asparagus and blue cheese stuffed green olives as garnish made it amazing!

The food was good!  Loved the fresh fruit blackberries and pineapple!  The eggs were over cooked but I have to say the thick cut bacon and the rosemary potatoes were tasty.  Too bad the potatoes lacked a real prominent rosemary flavor.  

Everyone was happy when we left a definite try again.  The ambiance of the place was warm and welcoming.  Our waiter was friendly and chatted with us a lot so it was nice.  It's hard to find a good Sunday brunch place in Spokane so I was happy to find this gem."
161054,"This place just continues to impress me.  The photography and decore is just as impressive as the food.  My wife from Morelia calls the tortillas here the best she has had in the US and reminiscent of her grandmothers, and the darker Oaxaca-style mole is always good.  I was a bit skeptical to try the pozole since I am used to delicious pozole made in the streets by the poorer families of Mexico, but, it was slightly better than I thought it would be.   Me encantaria regresar pronto!"
854933,"Oh how I love thee, Plum Bistro! You satisfy my GF urges and satiate me with your Africa salad filled with avacado, quinoa and yummy vinetrette. Your dark wooden interior puts me in cool urban loft spaces and on sunny says, the big bright garage roll up door puts me in outdoors. Oh if only I could date a restaurant. It would be you!! Xoxoxo"
907907,This place was very busy but we were still seated in under 20 minutes. We had an egg/taco scramble dish and a standard egg breakfast with bacon and toast. Both were very good. The coffee was also very good. Staff was friendly and attentive but not intrusive. I'd go again and recommend it to friends.
1919440,"I just recently moved to Seattle but I've already ate at Betty three times! Two out of three were all very important diners for me and my husband. We went to Betty to celebrate our engagement when he proposed to me last year and we went back to Betty again this year when we introduced our parents to meet with each other for their first time before the wedding!  I love the environment at Betty. It's a little bit dark and romantic. I also love their frequent changing menu, and there are only three or four options for appetizers, soup& salad, main course, and desert. I love this kind of menu because It won't take you too long to decide what you want. Each choices are all made out of seasonal fruits and vegetables, so you won't go wrong with any decision.  Services are excellent here as well. I highly recommend Betty to everyone who come to Queen Anne for a special supper!"
1947703,"Came in on a late Friday night... The service sucked! Nobody was friendly.  And the place was pretty packed.

Drinks were average... 

My sister and I split the gyozas (which again were pretty average) 

Each of us also ordered a sushi cone which was the only thing I liked here... especially that it was only $3.50

Not a fan of Joeys... would rather spend my money on a better experience!"
1312341,"Briljant that they have many happy hours! Their sushi is great, many original sushi names and.. I really liked the bad boy and Seattle roll! Also their tempura green tea ice is a blast. 

But make sure you come in around 4.. cuz later you might miss the boat because the place went full!"
1929524,"Awesome new pizza place. Great pizza, beer, ice cream. The beat salad is amazing. Service is great. Fun to sit outside in the summer. Bike friendly. Just off the trail from the Burke Gillman."
757678,"This was my first time trying Outback Steakhouse and I have got to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The food in the commercials always looks scrumptious so I was curious to see what the real thing was like. The restaurant is very family friendly and casual. There was a computerized touch screen menu at our table that allowed us to order without even speaking to the waiter if we pleased. We ordered an appetizer, the bloomin' onion, which was deep fried deliciousness. It was a little greasy but so so good. There was plenty and it was filling. I got a BBQ bacon burger and my boyfriend got a sirloin steak and we were both pleased with our meals. All in all, it was speedy and the service was great. The computer ordering was interesting, I wonder if that will become a norm in the chain restaurant industry. If it does I can't say I hate it, it was speedy, proficient and there were pictures for everything. All in all good experience! I would go back."
933685,My favorite teriyaki restaurant around.  I come here atleast once a week to get lunch.  The lunch prices are cheap and you get plenty of food. Woot Woot
1965175,"When I worked in the neighborhood I hit Cedars up a few times for lunch.  There is a plethora of Indian restaurants in the UDistrict, and I feel this one is one of the better, cleaner ones.  The food always tastes fresh and it is very good. The service can be really slow and un-attentive sometimes.  They do a decent tandoori chicken, and they serve side salads.

I never did try one of their curries, so i can't vouch for that, their naan isn't bad, either.  There's also another Cedar's in the UDistrict closer to the post office, this is the location across from the creepy UWay Safeway. It's a lot less scary looking than the former.  Try it out if you're in the neighborhood!"
212796,"I order online, pay online, and they bring me pizza
Pretty good pizzas
and they also bring pop
What? you thought I expected unicorns? This is pizza, at my place, and they're open till 1 am.. so yes.... 5 Big Stars"
906549,Ambience reminded me of small cafe in the mountains.  Food was good.  They accommodated my gluten and dairy allergies well.  Coffee strong...needed it that way.  Staff extremely friendly.  Would come back.
815055,"Interesting format of deciding what to eat first and then paying in the front. Afterwards we picked where to sit and a server came by to bring our orders. I have to say our waiter was very attentive and really friendly.

Okay for the food. We ordered a salad, pizza and pasta dish. I have to say all were good. The dishes prices range from $10-15. Good place after shopping in the morning."
823082,"I bought two Groupon deals for this place awhile back. I bought the deals based on the great reviews from consumers and the fact that they incorporated organic ingredients into their recipes. I went there first for lunch. I had an antipasto plate for an appetizer that included salami, got cheese, pistachios, tapenade and a baguette. It was flavorful and had a nice presentation. It was perfect to share with someone for a little appetizer before your meal. I then had a beat and goat cheese salad. The salad came out with just beats and goat cheese... it was not what I expected at all and not what many expect when they order a salad. I mean it was delicious but the fact that there were no other ingredients like salad, veggies, etc. was disappointing. It was also $10, which seems a little high for me. But considering they use organic products, they do have to charge more and it is definitely worth it. My boyfriend ended up getting their fish tacos. He is very particular about fish tacos and how they taste since he has them about everywhere he goes. He really liked them and their flavor. The fish was baked rather than fried so you don't get that crispy factor when biting into the taco, but he said that the flavor and seasonings overpowered that negativity. 
We then went there again for dinner. The ambiance was very comfy and cozy. The lights were dimmed, it was darker than most restaurants and they have candles on the table to light up the table. The decorations are very unique and eclectic. I really liked it. 
We first ordered the scallops for an appetizer. I was expecting those big lump scallops seared and topped with the sauce. Instead we got a baked dish full of baby scallops drowning in the sauce. I was pretty disappointed because they tasted like they were frozen so I was bummed. My entree was a step up though from the appetizer. I got the seafood linguini which was pretty good. It came with a lot of seafood and was in a rich and creamy sauce. It was yummy!! 
I say you should go there and if you find something you love, go for it! It is based on whats your cup of tea :)"
70010,"If you are a fan of good food with big portions, you'll even fall more in love with this place. Some of the meals I have tried here so far are their curry seafood (which sadly was a special of the day item), clams, mussels, their various types of poutine, veal burger and hummus appetizer. I honestly haven't had anything yet to disappoint my taste buds. Come to think of it, it's hard to pick out a favorite dish because everything is good here although I have heard great things of their clam chowder, which I shall try during my next visit.

The view at The Harbour Public House is very pretty! It overlooks the water, where you can see a lovely view of Seattle on a clear day. I have usually got lucky with getting a table by the window or outside."
1003478,"Two words ZORBA BURGER!!! Not just a 1/1lb of beef, it also has lamb! Boom! Thats the sound of your mind being blown. The tatziki sauce is one to the many flavors that this burger unleashes. The bun was a thing of perfection. It was crispy flaky but soft and delicious on the inside. Theyre ranch isnt a normal ranch, but dont be scared because it was the best ranch I've ever had. It goes great with theyre fries. I have no complaints on the service. I received my food at a timely matter but the only negative thing I have is that they gave my son apple juice when we ordered orange. But he's not a tough critic just yet."
1106302,"This coffee shop/bakery looks more attractive from the outside than from the inside. Those metal bistro tables and chairs outside caught my attention and the cappuccino was not that bad. The pastry rum, though, was overcooked and dry. 

I should have gotten some of those French size macarons (they have in different flavors and I really like they are not huge like in other places, macarons are supposed to be charming, not only sweet and tasty!).

The place is clean and neat, but the coffee shop atmosphere is lost with so many young Asian students just having more virtual than real conversations. Everybody glued to their laptops and phones, this kill the possibility of human interaction that you could imagine from outside."
2132720,"I've always wondered what the dishes prepared on Iron Chef would taste like...and now I know. Food like I can only barely imagine prepared with great skill and  top shelf ingredients. Throw in a small, nicely appointed intimate interior and an unobtrusive, efficient, informed waiter and it made for a memorable meal. My wife and I had 6 of the small plates and a desert each as the best way to get acquainted with the menu. I look forward to returning to sample some of the entrees.

Bon Appetit!"
1443444,"Super disappointed!  Went here for my daughter's birthday, and needless to say left super hungry!  We had the special of the day...$20.00 for THREE scallops..yes, three, with about a tablespoon of red cabbage...now I don't eat very much, and I was even hungry leaving this place...my husband had to forage for food  off my daughter's plates, which left everyone hungry!  Wow, we left with a large bill, and very hungry, and the food was just OK...never going back here...save your money and go somewhere else!! Booo!"
2164767,"First off, let me say that I'm biased towards the smaller, more home-grown coffee shops. Don't get me wrong, I love my Starbucks/Peets'/Philz... but these places are just a breed of their own. 

... and this place is no different. they know their coffee and one morning, I was just desperate for a cup of coffee. I saw this coffee place on my way to Pike Market and just had to stop in for a small cup. 

I love my coffee on the creamier side, so I opted for their Breve types. Got myself a Breve hazelnut latte and thought it was mighty delicious. definitely worth a stop in if you're in the area!"
2159934,"The food is average, typical bar and grill food. I love this place for what it is, an adults only theater where you can eat and drink while you watch a movie. 
It works well. You write your order on  a pad and place it upright so your server knows when you need something without always coming around disrupting your movie.
They actually have Fried Green Tomatoes, I don't think any other place around here does. They are pretty good too, though I have had better."
2165653,Got the burger of the gods. The feta (or gorgonzola) + balsamic grilled onions + 1 lb patty inside a brioche bun... It just worked. It really just worked.
790439,Solid pies.
1917200,"I visited Seattle for a few days and went here twice because it was so good the first time. Ample portions, delicious, local/organic. Very impressed."
666557,"Here's the skinny:

The fresh bread with aged balsamic and olive oil were divine.  Loved it.

The truffle butter pasta was so simple, yet absolutely delicious.

The eggplant parmesan was melt in your mouth goodness.

Wine list: Italian-based, as you can expect.  If you're not into Italian wine, well, this place might not be for you.  Pro tip: their pours are heavy!  Good thing for vinos.

Deceptively small on the outside, but huge on the inside, this place can get loud, but the tables are spaced out generously.  Service was top notch.

Prices: pretty pricey, but hey, you're in Capitol Hill and getting handmade pasta!"
1941668,The line moves slowly..but you won't be disappointed once you're munching.
761884,"After a long day of wine tasting, walking, and browsing in the sun, I was soooo ready to just sit and enjoy something yummy that had nothing to do with beer or bratwurst.  We were tipped off to South by one of the tasting rooms that we visited.

We were able to secure a table at 7:30pm for our group (two adults, two kids) and were seated shortly after returning to the restaurant at 7:30 (one more tasting room).  We wanted to sit outside - it's a super cute dining space, sort of San Diego rustic chic (that doesn't make sense) complete with string lights and reclaimed wood-looking tables.

We didn't do drinks because we'd been drinking all day, but we started with chips and the salsa bar.  The green salsa was awesome as was the salsa served with the chips.  We tore through the first bowl and were quickly served another to chew on while we waited for our food.  Our server was awesome, attentive without smothering, water was always full, dishes cleared immediately.

I ordered the taco plate with chicken tacos and sauteed veggies instead of beans.  The plate also had rice and coleslaw (pineapple dressing?) and it was seriously solid, satisfying food.  I was starving because I had ice cream for lunch and 90 different pours of riesling but nothing else, and this did the trick - tasty and a perfect portion.  My brother in law and my husband both ordered enormous carnitas burritos that they finished, and brother in law's girlfriend ordered fajitas that she said were really good.

We were able to have a leisurely meal in the adorable outdoor space, no hurries, no rushes, kids were appropriate, we felt totally welcome and a perfect way to wind down the evening.  Next time we're in Leavenworth we'll probably try something else, but this is such a solid choice for an evening meal."
880823,"Killer breakfast spot, or coffee spot. Big space in a tall warehouse area, the menu is written on the wall w/ chalk! 

They were serving waffles when I went- bacon maple. Win! Espresso was above average, but they ran out of dinnerware and served it in a to go cup instead. Also their coffee cups were glass, which looked great, but I prefer porcelain. 

Ample seating, friendly staff, I would venture to say they're the best of their kind in this neighborhood without question, but that I wouldn't go too far out of my way to get here."
1320958,"Seattle isn't exactly known for its Taiwanese food, and it is very very rare to be able to find a Taiwanese restaurant of Facing East's caliber. There's always a wait and it's easy to see why!

The restaurant is located in the corner of a little plaza with very limited parking spaces which were apparently all designed for mini coopers. So that part of it isn't fun.

Walk in and they'll hand you a spatula with a number on it (remember, there's always going to be a wait) and usually in about 30 minutes you get seated. The place has a pretty modern twist on a Chinese restaurant in terms of decor.

Anyway on to the important part. I came really craving good old fashioned Taiwanese beef noodle soup, so I ordered that and it definitely satisfied. I'd also recommend the Taiwanese pork burgers (I had no idea they were called ""burgers"" but hey Asian things are pretty commonly translated very poorly. Prices are fair for the quality and quantity of food they give you, and I honestly haven't tried a dish on the menu that I haven't liked yet."
1816341,"Huge portions.
Low quality ingredients.
Warm beer. 
MSG, probably.
The green curry was decent though. 
The other stuff, not so much."
592244,ok  its in broadway a great location so me n kj hit this mexi rest.was either mod pizza or pags or this place. big mistake  divey  .i knew soon as kj told me they had a buffet the kitchen was bad and the food was worst.its calld taco bell gone bad!!!anywys the decor is scary wth the empty buffet equipmnt lastnite. kj had the carnitas i thnk i had ala carte 2 chez enchis..advocado and rice the was good the refried beans were good too..now to the only plus was the service was good def wont  be back 40  bux for awful mexican sari ill pass .ALSO IF U EAT AT THIS SPOT BRING THE FREEBREEZE YR CLOTHES ILL NEED IT..
1325878,"If you are in Seattle I would HIGHLY recommend you make time to eat here.. even if the line is around the corner.. it's worth it!!!

Definitely a contender for the best sandwich I have ever had.  Went with my brother and 2 other buddies and we split 8 sammies between the 4 of us.

La Porchetta!!! hands down one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. We had one extra Porchetta sandwich that miraculously survived til the next morning and it was still delicious.

Lamb was great, Meatball was amazing, dont remember what else we ordered, but everything was gooood.."
1189324,"Used to order the juicy steak burrito all the time. It was very filling and tasty. However, I had to order the burrito bowl since I went flourless. It definitely feels much less satisfying though, even though the portion might now seem much less. Guess that's the magic of flour! :'("
1715608,"The food is FRESH and nori mild - so no fishy taste here. It's fun to the sit at the counter and watch the rolls being made and interact with the staff. 

Great service and the prices are reasonable too. It is not as sexy inside as Maru, but the food has more flavor, and the nori is softer and milder in flavor. Plus you don't have to endure the 'feed-trough' feeling you get when you're full and food keeps going past your table. 

If you go to sushi.com, try Nectar tasting room across the street for a delicious glass of wine and live music."
1080346,"A delightful well-designed and appointed  space with a simple menu, this little Pho place is an upscale new neighborhood gem.

Chicken Pho truly shines here and has been absolutely perfect both visits, the pork vermicelli was really good the first time but a bit too fatty for me the second visit. The cream puff was good but not my thing, so I'd skip it.

Service was good and super friendly but it can be overwhelming for one person to work the whole room so expect to be patient in getting your check if its busy.

Open on Sundays now, it's a convenient and delicious lunch or dinner option."
829356,Great steak but overpriced.  $49 for a rib eye?   Please.
2149062,"I wasn't super impressed with the food. Maybe I order the wrong thing... I had edamame, rainbow roll, and miso soup. I noticed my co-workers got lunch specials and they said they loved it. 

I've been to better sushi places. Their service was ok... I had to ask the waiter for water three times and had to try to get their attention for over 20 minutes to put our order in. 

The place is in a busy location and it looked great... 

I prices were ok, but I've had better sushi for less. 

Again, I must have gone the wrong day because my coworkers love this place. 

(This might be TMI but if you go here you must check out the restroom... totally high tech, something I had never seen before)"
244021,"This is true love. 

Every time I go, I order the same thing: 2 ""Taco Chukis"" tacos, 2 adobada tacos, 1 can of Tecate. 

One week I went four times. It's that good."
235591,"I came here with my boyfriend around 7pm on a Friday night. HoneyHole was pretty busy but we found a spot to sit by the bar. I always order the fast eddie. it's my favorite sandwich. Nothing beats thinly sliced steak, melty cheese, onions and sweet hot peppers! My boyfriends buddies ended up stumbling in while we were eating so he talked to them for a while. The blonde bartender was sweet and must have sensed my boredom because she unexpectedly bought me a shot of rum. I wasn't planning on drinking but that was the beginning of a really wild night."
1443085,"I used to work in the mall so being a regular here was an absolute must especially stoping by for lunch on game days.

Safe to say I've had almost everything here on the menu. And very beer too. 

Let's start with the beer (my favorite part).  If you are a beer enthusiast than this brewery delivers some of my favorites. Especially that Jeremiah's red which is a Irish style strong ale. Doesn't matter if you're into IPAs, porters, stouts or even lagers they have some good stuff.  Even seasonal beers that'll get you hop'n. See what I did there?

Now the food. Nothing there really screams ""must have!"" But don't expect to be able to successfully watch your calories eating here either. Even their salads are hefty. Burgers are huge. And pizza is mediocre. Pretty average for an American restaurant.

Service is hit or miss here. It kind of depends on whose the manager that day and how they feel.

Overall, decent place to watch the game."
882058,"Great space, nice crowd, excellent waiter (Chester?), good food.

Italian meats pretty boring (prosciutto/mortadella/salami - no mustard) - but alright.  Lamb special was perfectly cooked.  Bit pricey but not obscene.  Pork ok, not great.

All Italian wine list.

Great space.  Not too noisy but ""happening"", as they say...."
1006999,"Anyone who knows me knows that I have a weakness for macaroons. Others might say it's an obsession.

Anyway, I was stopping by the UPS store to drop off a package when I stumbled upon this place. I quickly looked it up on Yelp and saw to my delight that they sold...macaroons! I sent my husband in because I'm lazy and only like to eat macaroons...and he came out with 6 delightfully cute ones. One was either strawberry or raspberry (PINK) and the others were vanilla and lemon. They were smaller than I am used to...but they were delicious regardless. They had just the right amount of crunch and inside goo. I liked the vanilla the best - I'm usually not a fan of lemon or strawberry but I was surprisingly happy with all three flavors.

At first I was shocked when my husband said that these suckers were $11 but then if you compare it to, say, Le Panier in Pike Place, it's really a steal. 

So excited that there's a macaroon place nearby."
978869,"The quality here has gone down a tad, which saddens me tremendously.  I came in on a weekday during the tail end of the anniversary sale, and I was quite disappointed.  It took over 30 minutes for my chicken burger to arrive; the waiter never checked in with me; and it took nearly 10 minutes after eating to get my check.

The burger was ok but dry.  The fries were luke warm, as if they had been sitting out for a while."
992878,"I came here on a quarterly catch up sessions with one of my girlfriends. Spent a few hours here on a Tuesday evening enjoying many plates and drinks. Although I didn't know quiet what to expect, being it seems kinda out of place for Tacoma on 6th Ave. I had the marrow because obvs as well as an heirloom tomato peach salad. Very rich, very good. Wine was perfect. I will come here again."
1937401,"Before you look at my star rating, please read my story on their HORRIFIC customer service.

On a Wednesday morning, I tried calling for two hours to put in an order for an afternoon pick up. After no one answered their phone, I came in around 1:30pm to put the order in in person. The restaurant was packed, there were 6 people sitting in the waiting area, and two other people standing at the counter - I assume waiting for their pick-up order. 

I stood at the counter for 10 minutes before anyone addressed me. Waitresses walked past, back and forth, never asking if I had been helped. Finally, a man who had been standing behind the counter, who had even made eye contact with me multiple times while I stood there waiting, finally asked me, ""What do you want?"", I calmly said to put in an order. ""Did you call?"" ""Yes, for the past 2 hours, no one answered"" - and with that he threw up his arms, ""I don't have time for you, leave, leave"" and waved his hands towards the door. 

I was embarrassed and shocked by his rude confrontation. The people around me seemed embarrassed, too, but kept their eyes on the ground. I couldn't believe I was addressed in that way, I was too embarrassed to respond. I turned around and left - mad, disappointed, full of shame, and with an empty stomach. 

I am now instantly reminded of the Seinfeld Soup Nazi. 

The only way a restaurant can get away with being shockingly rude to a customer is if the food is simply incredible. And their damn Garlic Chicken/Tofu is the most amazing dish ever. I never, ever order tofu but the way they caramelize the dish, the tofu becomes so yummy - it's crispy and soft, amazing. The chicken can get a little chewy, so I think from now on I'll order it with tofu. Their pad thai sucks. 

Despite how embarrassingly rude they were to me... I'll probably go back. Is that sad?"
2721768,"I went here not too long ago and the food is delicious without a doubt. I love the halibut lettuce wrap sampler there and it was quite good. I also had a filet mignon which they put on top of some corn meal which to my surprise was very very tasty. The wine of course was very delicious and we did a wine sampler.

I gave this place 4 stars because of the price! If your looking to get full here without spending an arm and a leg then you've come to the wrong place! If you just want to relax with friends and loved ones and have a tasty snack then you will love this place!"
1755245,"Rice and spice is soo good! We have them deliver or we run in and pick it up. Either way, they're always delivering great service and food every time! The Thai iced teas are bomb. I haven't had one bad thing. I'm a wuss with spicey things, so I always get no stars and it's perfect. Check them out!"
851596,"You can't go wrong here.  Both the Indian and the Mediterranean food is amazing! My go to dish that I won't even dare not to order is the Mezza appetizer plate. Everything on it tastes delicious, even the baba ganoush, which has to be next to perfect for me to even try. My sister always gets the chicken tikka masala, and it has not failed us to date. Also, the garlic naan is very good, and it is HUGE! Just order one for your table of four to start. If you conquer it, then order the next one mid way through your meal. Lastly, the drink menu. I'm the type of person that usually sticks to the water that they serve, but a friend of mine ordered the hot chai tea, of which I took a sip....INCREDIBLE! Slightly on the addictive side because it is so good. And to add icing to the cake....there are endless refills on it. You don't even have to ask. Before you finish, there is someone already pouring you another cup. I have also had a few sips of my sister's mango lassi, also delicious."
1968466,"We came here with a Amazon Local deal for brunch.  It came with 2 mimosas per person.  While the mimosas were good and the sparkling wine used in them was of fair quality, I don't see myself buying them again.  They cost $7 each.  We started off with the unique Calallo soup and it was creamy with coconut and kale and the pulled chicken in it was pleasing.  Andrew got the herb crusted halibut and fries.  They don't have tarter sauce there??  Instead they have a cilantro remoulade.  I didn't like the remoulade, but Andrew thought it was good and complemented the halibut.  The halibut was cooked well, it wasn't greasy and manageable to eat by hand.  Not the largest quantity for the price, but one of the best things about it was how well the leftovers reheated in the oven.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was wonderful.  The ciabatta roll was yummy and toasted perfectly.  Tons of mozzarella on it.  We both really liked the French fries, but they were over salted for us.  It was a nice sea salt, but just too much for us.  The view is great, parking is validated, and the water is pleasant, although it seemed kind of odd for a place like this and in this price range, to serve the water in plastic cups.

We will go back again."
902420,"I got the Reuben and it was on the best I ever had . Definitely going back. The place is very (looks like a butcher shop ). Regardless, their Reuben are out of the world"
164909,"Numero Uno Stop of Monsieur Marc's UYBC. This is a great place for good grubbin' and beers [and alcohol in general]. I tried someone's pulled pork and kimchi pizza, cheese and my asparagus with p-something meat. Yummeh. We held down the SW wall upstairs.

Note to staff and rest: In the far left corner upstairs below the beer screen, there's a few power connections on the floor. When your table next to it is full, be careful with your glasses! Don't want to spill anything and start a fire, thanks. :)"
1108102,"We went in tonight for a to go order and it was HORRIBLE!!! My husband ordered from the host when he got there and was told it was going to take a bit longer because they were busy and we are perfectly fine with that. He put in the order then told the host he was going to sit at the bar and was given a buzzer they would biz him when it was ready. Well . . . over 45 minutes passed and he finally went up to the host and asked about the order . . . well yeah they lost the ticket you would think that after 25 minutes you'd be concerned that your guests order hasn't come up, nope not here! The manager did come out and was nice enough (my husband was very understanding and was way more kind then I would have been about the situation) she took care of our order ( which was 1 order of ravioli and a salad and broccoli) which for the issue is pretty much a given. However, that's it! Not to sound ungrateful at all but no ""hey I threw in an appetizer because you had to wait over an hour"" or hey even ""here's my card and here's a free appetizer on us next time for waiting over an hour for your food"", no nothing like that. With all the competition in that area they should be working for every guest! Let's just say that next time we are in the area and thinking about getting to go food or heck even eating out we will drive the extra mile and get always great service at PF Changs or even Olive Garden, because I'm sure they service can't be worse. All in all we probably won't be back unless the people we are with insist on going here!

And to boot my husband got home with it and it was wrong they forgot his salad"
1189416,"First off, I should be chastised for being surprised that there is good food in Puyallup. I've already eaten outstanding Thai and pho, so excellent Indian should not be a stretch.

Everything about Karma gives me warm fuzzies-charming decor, amazing service, funny bar/lounge with FREE shuffleboard and pool. Really? Does it get any better in the South End? Maybe not..

We ate all the usual things from the vegetarian menu and the curries were really delicious. Portions are reasonable and we were stuffed after sharing onion bhajis, naan and three veggie entrees.

After dinner we moved to the bar, and were surprised and pleased by the bartender extensive whiskey/scotch knowledge and all around good nature. It's a long drive from Seattle (when there is so much to eat here) but anytime I have a reason to drive south I will surely eat here."
893928,"Quick caveat: the outdoor seating is 4 stars ... the view is great, especially on a nice day.  But that is just about the only thing this restaurant has going for it.  

The food is overpriced for low quality.  There is really nothing on the menu that you'd come back for.  I recently went with a buddy and we ordered orders of fries and sweet potato fries. Both orders came out luke warm.  How hard is it to deliver hot fries?  

Beer selection is OK, but nothing stellar.  

Overall, this place is essentially a Red Robin with a nicer view.  If you are cool with inflated prices, knock your socks off."
2152602,"If you truly enjoy traditional sushi rolls and Japanese food I would NOT recommend this restaurant. I'm not sure what kind of alien fusion restaurant you would call this place, but I wanted Japanese food, I didn't get it,  and I walked out angry.

There are only 3 things you need to know about this place. 

1. It offers Mexican Sushi NOT Japanese (Cilantro and JalapeÃ±os in sushi?)

2. It's SUPER EXPENSIVE 

3. There's NO PARKING

There's nothing suckier than shelling out $$$ for mediocre shitty food. 12 dollars for a SMALL fist full of overly salty calamari... ughhhh. Their apparent ""top"" selling sushi roll the ""super bad boy"" felt like creamy mush in my mouth. Cream cheese, lots of different mayo flavors... and...  I couldn't taste anything else, there was so much going on.

I understand that just because something is new and deviates from the traditional doesn't make it bad. But the food I had here was NOT worth the price. 

All this being said. I give Japonessa 2 stars and here's why:

1. Service. My water glass was never empty and the server was super attentive. 

2. Variety. It does have a variety ranging from Agedashi Tofu,  Udon, Sashimi, Calamari, to Salads etc... All of which I did not try. But 20$ for shitty rolls... no thank you.

There are vast amounts of awesome Japanese restaurants in Seattle for a reasonable price. You would be coming here for the hype and atmosphere... and less for the quality of food."
1087397,"UPDATE!
Ok, I finally came here with a coworker who loves trying out various Vietnamese Pho places in Seattle.  There are a couple that he adores and believes no one else could top it.

Until now.

We decided to have a sit down lunch and we both ordered a shared appetizer of sweet potato and shrimp and our respected order of Pho (I got the combo and he got the well done).  The broth was divine and rich with flavor.  The service was great, even with I pulled a stupid and spilled my drink all over the table.  The only down side is, I think the price is a bit high.  My coworker moved this place to the top of his list and would definitely come back as a regular.

As for my previous post, I would have to say, order the more common dishes for appetizer such as spring rolls, egg rolls, etc.  The more obscure ones may not turn out as you expect."
1903859,"So disappointed at how I was treated tonight. I went in at 6:35p on a Wednesday and asked for a to-go order. Nothing major, just dinner for 2 kids. 

The hostess had to check with the manager about to go orders. She came back and said the don't do to go food!  I told her that I had taken food to go several times before. 

She went back to check again. The on duty manager's name was reportedly Natalie St. Something (St. Audon?). A second time she reported that the kitchen is too busy and they wouldn't make me a to go order. 

So unfortunate. I like their burgers but once I'm turned away, rudely, I won't be back."
805646,"I'd heard many great things about this place, but was not prepared for the level of  intimate service, intricate food pairing suggestions, and thoughtfulness.

My date and I were greeted at the door by the ever-charming and gregarious Maloney, who took our coats and whisked us to a secluded table by the window.  

He asked us what our 3 favorite things in the world were, and before I could ask him why, he put his finger to my lips and pirouetted towards the bar, only to return shortly with two of the most exquisite cocktails we had ever had the pleasure of knowing.  

In between regaling us with his tales of his adventures far and wide, he would deliver plate after plate of tempting tidbits and unusual flavors.  

We were taken aback to say the least.

While never seeming to put down his ever-present tallboy can of PBR, he amused and delighted us with (slightly) off-color jokes, only accentuated by his Cheshire grin and the constant stroking of his Greek-God like beard.  

Seriously,  this man Maloney has a beard that would make Sam Beam weep with envy.   Full and manly, yet soft and luscious, it should hang in a museum.  

Our 4 hour orgy of dining and drinks went by only too quickly and Maloney never seemed to stray  from our side.  

When I asked him if he had other tables or guests to attend to, he just winked and said, ""yes"".  

That was good enough for us.  

If you ever have the chance to visit The Ballard Loft, I urge you to do so.  

And be sure to ask for the man they call Maloney by name.  

You will not be disappointed"
839039,"MMMM. The risotto cakes were delicious! They also have a serious gin selection and make a rockin' G&T with extra lime. Yum!

Not a lot of option for those watching their waistline so I went all-in with the risotto cakes. They were tasty and the portion seemed large...but I left hungry. Probably more about me than them though!

Minus one star because the waitress tacked on gratuity for our group of 6 but didn't mention it. I'd already signed my tag adding MORE gratuity before someone in the group figured it out. I didn't make a fuss, but I think it's common courtesy to announce to the group this will happen."
926459,"Disclaimer: I have never liked this place and every single time one of my co-workers suggests we eat lunch here, I sigh. I'm quite frankly shocked at all of the rave reviews--maybe brunch and dinner are stronger than lunch? The food is middling at best--an Ahi Tuna Salad is a heap of lettuce, a smattering of tomatoes and A LOT of dressing. It's not great, but it's typically not super offensive--nothing to write home, or rather, write Yelp about. But lunch today was the tipping point. 

Our server was bizarre-o world from the beginning, a jumble of slurred speech, flailing limbs, and inappropriate comments,  and I'd like to believe that she was under the influence of something--pills, booze, Wal-Phed. Maybe all three at the same time.  We had a party of seven, and she brought us a single glass of water and then told us that the rest of our water was at the bar (we would have to ask three more times, individually, to get water). She then disappeared behind the bar and when she returned to take our order, didn't have a pen and paper to do it with. Which, you know, fine. If you're an amazing server, that's cool. But it didn't bode well for our lunch.

Our drink orders? Totally jacked. One person never received a drink, and watching her attempt to give out our drinks was similar to watching a blind person play a game of ""Memory"" with a deck of cards. Minutes ticked by, glasses were drained with no refills, and 50 minutes after our food order was placed, about half of our table received food. 15 minutes later, she returned with two more plates, plus a bonus mystery plate of food that no one ordered, and, after surveying the table with bleary eyes, said ""Everything good?"" while missing the fact that one of the people at the table had no food at all. When this was pointed out to her, she took it as a personal insult and snapped at us. She didn't ask what he ordered to confirm that she had my boss' order correctly noted (a side salad). She came back with a buffalo chicken sandwich. (Meanwhile, my Ahi Tuna Salad? Inedible. I am positive that the tuna was either slightly bad or well on its way, and the tomatoes on the salad tasted moldy. Lettuce was wilted and brown.)

At this point, our lunch hour was long past finished and my boss was angling to get back to the office, so he gently pushed the plate away and waited for the rest of us to finish. Our server returned and said ""It's not right, again?"" through gritted teeth and while holding clenched fists. My boss said he didn't want a replacement item and ended up leaving lunch a bit early. 

As I said before, I don't like the food, but during my team's previous trips to Calamity Jane's the friendly service and speedy turnaround time for food made it a sensible choice for a pleasant team lunch. This time, our server was totally unapologetic for her myriad struggles, and when the manager kept coming to talk to us, she said she did so because she ""sensed weirdness."" Yeah, a lot of weirdness, owing to the fact that we received sub-par service in every conceivable way. 

When we left Calamity Jane's, our server said ""I'm sorry it was so weird, but what can you do?""

What you can do? Your job."
898241,I really enjoy this place. It's close to home an they play really good music.  The bar is awesome and their brew is outstanding!  I've been a fan of their pizzas but also like they have burgers and sandwiches.   It's very family friendly!!
2196307,"Wasabi or Umi? That is the question. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Umi, but Wasabi wins and here's why:

Appetizer selection. Wasabi has more choices that are a bit more creative. Plus, it's no secret I love pork belly and there it is, sprinkled all over the menu in all kinds of fun ways.

Drinks. Fuji Apple Martini! Exclamation point! So deliciously sweet and refreshing. I've had many apple martinis and there's just something about this one that's different. I can drink three or four of these like it's apple juice.

The decor is cool. I like the modern vibe. Some days I'm just not feeling it. Too trendy maybe? But that's whatev.

Happy hour. This is what sets Wasabi apart from Umi the most, for me. Fabulous selection of items that are normal-sized portions for cheapsies. Cheapsies = $5-$7 or a spectacular 3 for $14 deal! 

Wasabi, please don't ever, ever, ever change your happy hour, it's PERFECT. Well, you can add more neat stuff or drop prices. Maybe make that Fuji apple martini super cheap. That's acceptable, but that's it! You already pissed me off when you shut down for a ridiculously long time, don't you do it again. Seriously though, the happy hour is fantastic!"
975436,"These guys nailed it.  The pizza is great and they even offer some pies where they donate money to a good cause if you buy them.  My favorite is the fire station (sorry if i got it wrong).  It is a tangy, spicy pizza.

Here is what stands out:  The crust and generous toppings.  Aside from the food, they did a good job building it out.  

Go try this place.  I am a pizza snob and i liked it.  Zekes can kiss my butt."
777453,There's a reason we have doctors and surgeons and also people to explore the nether regions of our souls.  Our eyes are not equipped to see our own insides from the darkness of our own equatorial inzones.

1503398,"Great spot for a pre-funk before a Paramount show. It was nearly empty on a Tuesday night at 5PM, but it started filling up as it got closer to show time. They had 3 beers on tap, and 1 cider, so if you like a huge draft selection look elsewhere, but they were all great PNW micros so points for quality!  ($4 on happy hour). The pickle chips with a tangy mustard sauce at $5 hit the spot too. Bring your jacket though because its drafty! 

Pros
Not too crowded for happy hour
Pickle Chips!
One block from the Paramount

Cons
Downtown parking
Cold! Be prepared to need your coat"
1819436,"Very long wait on Saturday mornings. AMAZING hash browns, a bit different but so tasty! I had the banana pancakes and they were fantastic, great flavor. Pretty spendy for what you get and our waiter was really weird about clearing our table in a timely manner. We had empty plates sitting before the rest of our food came and he just kept walking past (it was very clear he saw them and that they were in our way) it was really frustrating especially since we were seated at a small table. Other than that I wouldn't mind returning."
255932,"An okay place for breakfast. They have a pretty good selection, which I like. I had their blueberry pancakes, and sides of hash browns and bacon. Everything was okay, but for a pancake house, I was expecting more."
924087,"One of the best spots on the Eastside for brunch and happy hour.

Those are low bars, I know, but bear with me here...

The hype regarding the plate o' bacon is deserved.  It is thick, candied, and smoky.  It is basically a small pile of porcine perfection.  You WILL get one, and you WILL love it.

For brunch, the malted waffles, biscuits and gravy, and most sandwiches (especially the Beecher's grilled cheese) are solid.  The pork belly benedict might be worth skipping, though, as the brown butter sauce doesn't really work here.

The daily happy hour drink specials are worth checking out, especially if you're into cocktails.  The food specials are disappointing though, besides the pretzel, and the aforementioned bacon plate.

Service is fine, even during busy times.  It would be a great spot for a weekend afternoon date, but the room does get pretty loud as the evening crowd rolls in.

The Eastside is a bit of a wasteland for brunch and happy hour.  But Lot No. 3 is certainly one of your better options."
1211133,"This is favorite dinner spot for my fiancÃ© and I. He can get the steak he wants, while I get my salad and yummy drinks. Seating is comfortable and private. The bar has nice seating for larger groups if you go out with a bunch of friends. Servers are always friendly."
1956483,"Upscale comfort food, with upscale prices. Fish and chips a little bland, popcorn shrimp a little salty. But it all seemed fresh, and the bar is nice."
1762684,"So, here is my update for this hometown hero(gyro)-

More than one years and countless falafels later, I'm still very much enamored of this hole in the wall.

We finally ordered from the takeaway window, late last night. The service was as stellar as during the day, the staff were fast, friendly, and totally patient with the onslaught of drunken gyro-worshipppers.

The food was fast, reasonable and much easier to obtain than firing up the stove here at home, 'round midnight.

Love these guys, keep doing what you're doing!"
266200,"great food! service was fast, drinks were strong parking and was easy."
1239766,"Just had one of the best breakfasts EVER! Coffee was great as was the service, and the farmers market scramble was delicious. The pastries in the coffee shop part of the place looked wonderful. Highly recommend."
796275,"My company reserved the downstairs room for a party we were having and couldn't have had a better experience.  And I should say that THE ROOM WAS FREE!!!  There was just a minimum order amount which we had no problem making, even though we had far fewer people show up than we anticipated.
First, the reservation process was smooth as silk.  I emailed back and forth with a gentleman named Corey who helped me with my order, and even suggested I cut back on my order (fewer big bowls of salad) saying that they would refill them throughout the evening if we needed more.  No payments were required upfront, which was also nice since it was just one less logistic I needed to coordinate before the event.
When we arrived, I met our fantastic bartender and host, Garrett.  (Yes, the downstairs room has it's own fully stocked bar!).  I can't say enough about how great he was throughout the evening.  We had pre-ordered a TON of food but found out that they would make the pizzas as the night went on so that we wouldn't have to pay for our full pre-order unless we needed it.  (We also had the option of ordering more than our pre-order if we needed it.)  This was really a big help because as I said, we had far less people than we needed.  Garrett was attentive to our food needs, drink needs, lighting, decor, helped get us a knife and serving implements for a cake we brought, etc.  He was fantastic.  I'm feeling a little bad because I think I may have under-tipped him at the end of the night.  My math is not great.  I think I gave him 18%, but would have liked to have given him more.
I would HIGHLY recommend the Alibi Room for your private party or event.  Fantastic place, fantastic people!"
1896728,This is a decent bar/lounge here in Capitol Hill. Came here after dinner and got a seat at a table. Fairly crowded for a Saturday night. Had to wait a bit in the beginning for our server but when she did come she was friendly and fairly knowledgable about the drinks. Tried some of their mixed drinks and some tried and true classics. Worth swinging by for a drink if you're in the area.
2143839,"Favorite place ever! Anything you order will blow you away. I once spent 55 bucks on sandwiches alone so I could stock pile my fridge. I like the exclusiveness of paseo no sign on the building, close when they run out of food, cash only, and always a line. The combination of the ingredients that go into the making of their food is down right incredible. I love the crispness of their sandwich bread, tenderness of the meat that goes into the sandwiches, the creamy amazing ness of the aioli sauce and throw some jalapeÃ±os on the sandwich for a little kick and you've found heaven. If you've yet to go or are from out of town do not miss this!"
1136743,Definitely a viet owned restaurant. But the food is bomb and fixes any other issues that you could have with the place. I have eaten there about 40-50 times and have never gotten sick or had anything wrong with my food.  What me and my girlfriend always get when we go there is Pork Fried rice and the Roasted Duck noodle(dry style). When ever we go there we want to try other things but we always go back to these two items because they are so damn good. As for appetizers my favorite is the Chicken wings. I once ordered a couple trays full of them to take to a party i was going to because i wanted every one to experience how amazing they were.
231544,"Must Order: Pistachio French Macaron

I headed in here to get out of the rainy weather and have me a yummy breakfast! After contemplated what delicious pastry to order from the many options, I settled on the chocolatine. I also ordered a cafe mocha and two french macarons to go.

Chocolatine: I wished that this was warm. Any croissant/pastry with chocolate in the middle is oodles better warm with gooey creme coming out! The pastry was delish but my salmon pate piroshky overshadowed it for sure.

French Macarons: I need to find a better way of transporting macarons because they always end up squished in my pocket or purse! In either case, they were yummy! Bite sized little cookie/creme like morsels, I can't help but want to order one of each! I ended up with the noisette (hazelnut) and pistachio flavors. Pistachio by FAR was my favorite of the two and even of everything I purchased from there!

All in all, I really liked the shop and enjoyed sitting at the window people watching and enjoying my rather large breakfast."
1678021,"My wife and I made our first visit to Fish Tale for dinner tonight.  Unfortunately I have a horrible memory so I can't remember our waitresses name.  She was helpful and checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything.  

We both ordered the fish tacos and fries.  We agreed that the tacos were some of the best we have had.  They had a nice spicy flavor but not so much that it overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  

My wife ordered the regular fries while I got the garlic & parmesan.  The garlic fries were good enough that my wife kept swiping them off of my plate.  

We had picked up some Spire apple cider at the store last week and enjoyed it so my wife tried the pear cider.  She finished the whole pint, which she rarely does when drinking, so it must have been good.  

I had the Wild Salmon Pale Ale and enjoyed it.  After one imperial pint I was ready to have another but we were running short on time.  We will be sure to visit again when in Olympia."
1889526,"Vietnamese food done right! Canh chua ca, ca kha to, goi cuon, banh beo - oh my! Impeccable service from the very sweet owner and the place is CLEAN! You can't really ask for more.."
1322633,"Very disappointing.  Website indicates they offer ""BIGS"" with 30% more meat/toppings, but the location I went to didn't offer it.  Tiny sandwich....very little meat....asked for x-tra mayo--barely got any...asked for mustard..got none....asked for provolone instead of swiss...got neither."
1026867,"This place has awesome food--and great home-brewed/made drinks.  Even for a GF girl like me, it had great salads and other options.  The atmosphere is good, not too sports-bar-ish, but just a good neighborhood place that's kick back and cool.  Best part of Next Door is going to the bathroom--there are two doors, one says, ""Men's Rest Room Next Door"" (with an arrow) and the door it's pointing to says ""Women's Rest Room Next Door"" (with an arrow)--you should see all the people standing in the hallway trying to figure it out, it's hilarious!  Hint: if you walk into a room with a urinal and you're a woman, you're in the wrong one!  Great play on words for this gastropub--hip place without all the hipster attitude."
1786983,"Second time here. Service is pretty bad. When we got sat we were asked to pick any table(which was cool), however the table we picked was dirty and the server didn't tell us until we say down and had menus. So he had to wipe our table clean while we were browsing the menu. Food was good as always, both times. We asked for no onions and we still received onions. When our food was served server didn't take away our appetizer plate, and ignored my empty soda cup. Good food. Horrible service."
1035975,"LOVEEE this place!! My husband and I went alone the first time and when we went back we had to take our 8 year old son. He had so much fun, even our 6 month old was paying attention lol! We had Kai as our chef and just had to request him the second time. He is hilarious and has everyone laughing. I love the fried rice-or fried lice as Kai says =P It is kind of spendy here, but I agree with Lee F. come hungry but patient! I think both times we have gone we have had to sit for about 20 minutes before anything happens. You sit at a table with other people, which at first I thought would be weird but ended up having conversations with the people around me. I love that they give you a little of what everyone orders...they will put a little bit of shrimp, beef and chicken on your plate but will load your plate up with what you originally ordered."
784165,Great happy hours!
2543265,"Great food! I had an antipasti for lunch-- it was like sitting on a  piazza in Rome and enjoying the delicately flavored meats and sublimely sharp cheeses. With rich strong Italian coffee and grilled bread w/ olive oil  - finishing touch lemoncello gelato a perfect ending to a great lunch . The owner introduced himself and told us a little of the history. It is a warm, comfortable and intimate ambience with a feeling of hospitality. A Great spot.!"
1897569,"We are forever in debt to the concierge at our hotel that turned us on to Cask & Trotter. We were looking for a good spot for lunch and a place to defrost after watching the Seahawks Super Bowl victory parade. 

We were visiting from Los Angeles and had no expectation whatsoever of finding great BBQ in Seattle. But low and behold, that's just what happened. GREAT BBQ exists in Seattle!!!!!!!!!!!!

When we walked in, we found the setting to be simple and cool. The servers were super friendly and really went the extra mile to give you they sense that they wanted you to have a good time and enjoy a great meal. 

You have to start with the Bloody Mary which features an incredible bacon garnish. For our mains, I ordered pork ribs, beans and slaw. It was aces and amplified by the incredible homemade sauces they had at the table. My girlfriend ordered the brisket and could not stop talking about how perfectly it was prepared and presented. 

Cask & Trotter is what happens when passion meets vision and the right people are hired to execute. I highly recommend this place. Trust me, you wont be disappointed.

790823,"I knew this was a small-plate place, but it was really ridiculously tiny plates of food. With small-plate establishments, the price should reflect the fact that you are getting a fraction of a full plate joint. Like tapas...the price should reflect not only what is in the dish, but the size of the dish. However, at Lark the plates are eensy weensy and the price is holy moly. I am not a cheapskate either, but come on!!!! A beet salad for $12 that has a single beet quartered up and 2 frisee lettuce leaves? The shrimp dish had a few tiny little shrimp that were flavorless. And why, oh why, did they have such crappy wine by the glass choices and no bottles under $45? Seriously?  I can't say I will ever go back. For the price, the taste of the food was mediocre and just not worth it. The four of us left there with a $250 tab and still hungry, and there's no excuse for that."
2504539,"I went here for a Saturday morning brunch and ordered the Cali Benny with bacon. Everything was delicious, the coffee was good, and the fruits and veggies were fresh. In addition, unlike some places, the waitstaff made no fuss about me coming in by myself and people watching. It's awkward in some places to eat alone, but here it wasn't which was excellent.

The only downside: it's a little expensive, but I'm used to eating at hole-in-the-wall east coast diners so my expectations are different. Overall, would go to again!"
864827,"Went on a very late less busy night (this place can get busy!) and got cocktails from Joey B. The man is a master at his craft.
  
Best bar experience and cocktails I've ever had -- and I'm a microbrew man at heart!
  
I'll be coming back!"

913867,"I was so excited to find another establishment in my neighborhood but I should have read Yelp first.  This place is horrendous.  The service is god awful, the waiters have ZERO personality, and the drinks and food are rather high priced for what they're actually worth."
1730845,"When I entered this place, I thought I had entered that Cow barn that exploded in Berlin, DE (huffingtonpost.com/2014/¦).

 Although there was enough food on the floor to start a grazing party, my wife insisted that we order a platter of half-cooked potatoes and some brown water. As we were grazing with other old farts, the master came to our table peppering creamer on the platter to make these potatoes and eggs more digestible. That's what I call Cowsumer service--a rare treat; So many places nowadays treat you like a human being.

I'd suggest renaming that barn: Pete's Dung Nest."

Try to go outside of lunch hour as it could get really really busy, and it's a small place."
1305908,"Found this place on my way to Carnation for our pumpkin trip...wholly crap! Grass fed beef & elk burgers, who'd of thought this little place would be such a treasure. I now know where I will stop on my way home from the Pass."
1312547,"Just like a good episode of the Jersey Shore, I am all about the DTF. DTF is like the girl you bring home from the bar after midnight and she's great for a moment, but you don't want to stick around. It's that moment of victory and regret all at the same time. You just hope she doesn't do too much talking and that she doesn't leave you with a gift that keeps on giving. If you're struggling with this analogy, I suggest using the Google machine to help you. 

I first had DTF in Taipei when I went there for a friends wedding. I was sold on the fact that they are some of the best dumplings I would gave. This was true, and I think continues to be held as true. 

I came back from Taipei and DTF opened shortly after. Maybe a year or so after. I took me forever to come here until as of recent. I kept hearing ""not as good as Taipei"" and ""Oh, yeah, but it's not as good as Taipei."" So, I just never came (again, like the girl you brought home from the bar). 

I've been on a XLB kick lately and would have to say that I had some tasty ones in NYC and more recently, had some excellent ones at Shanghai River in Richmond, BC. It was time to throw down on the DTF because, well, I be down with DTF. Although, depending on what you order, you might just good too full for any post-dinner DTFing. 

What did we eat you ask? (that's what she said)
- XLB (x2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
- Shrimp and Pork Shuimai http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
- Spicy Pork and Shrimp Wontons http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
- Ms. Choy (call her Bok) http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
- Pork Buns http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦

Everything was very good. I still say, that even from the Taipei (and it's biased because of course when you're on vacation, in another country, having a good friend of your take you to the best dumpling place in the world, and when you think back about it 5 years later, you think, yeah, that was the best I ever had, even it wasn't) it's still good. 

There is a wait to be seated, and on a Monday night, which is annoying. Although, if you're the inconspicuous white guy, and they girl comes around calling out names like ""Tim"" ""Steve"" ""Mark"" ""John"" or any other inconspicuous white guy name, then well, just claim one of them and bump yourself to the front of the line. Thanks, Mark!

The XLB, of course, are good. And yes, like everybody else says, it's expensive. We can all talk about the cheap places somewhere else in the world, country, or in the ID but well, I think DTF is still a solid. I mean, you're going to have to buy the girl a couple drinks anyways at the bar, right? That's not free. 

I like that they generally do a pretty good job keeping your water filled. And it has ice in it too! Oh how I love the Eastside and their ice water unlike all those new ""hip"" Seattle a-hole restaurants opening that think it's refreshing to serve warm water. I call that cheap and lazy so at DTF, you get your money's worth on the water and you could pay more $$ in Seattle for dinner and get warm water. The glass is half full (pun intended)."
1194204,"I've come many times only for Sunday brunch which is not too bad. Food is good but not the best; however it meets expectations.
What is really annoying is the girl that acts as a hostess. Last Sunday Nov 10th I stopped by with my wife and after waiting for a few minutes to be seated we were offered the bar. We actually don't like the bar because it's noisy so we asked for a table in the dinning room. She replied that that room was only for dinner (we always had the brunch there because it has a cozy fireplace!!). She went ""to check inside"" and after a couple of minutes she got back to us with a couple of menus and bad attitude saying ""folllow me"". We're still waiting her ""enjoy your brunch"" or something similar. What the hell is wrong with her??? Such a bitter welcoming!
Our server though was very nice and even remembered us from other visits.
Not sure if I'll come back."
2155184,"The food is always good... The service is always good... the wait sucks! If you are looking for a quick bite as a walk in, well you will be waiting for a table a little longer than you may want. At the end of it all you will still come back."
1313857,"Food isnt bad, just over priced. The artichoke dip was good, the braised beef and mushroom tortillino was good, a little salty but pretty good... not worth $17 though.  Also the Arnold Palmer tasted like water. Either the lemonade was bad or the iced tea wasnt strong enough. The service is usually a hit or miss. Just average food and average service. Nothing special, its Olive Garden what do you expect? Breadsticks and salad will always be the best to me."
2134749,Great location. Nice atmosphere. Excellent menu. It's hard to go wrong here.
861722,"I'm so over Paseo. While Paseo's Tofu Delight is indeed one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, their horrible customer service outweighs their culinary prowess. For the fourth time in the past 3-4 months, I've been told ""Sorry, we're out of sandwiches."" TWO HOURS before closing time. This last time, it happened not when I called so didn't have much time invested, but after I'd stood in line for half an hour (I've been told when I've called in before to order that people physically in line have ordering priority). Right when it's my turn to order, they tell me they're out of sandwiches. And they said this just to me. They did nothing to notify the other people still standing in line. 

Perhaps they should take some lessons from the Canlis family, Tom Douglas, Renee Erickson or any other award-winning Seattle chef on kitchen inventory and running a business. Either set earlier closing hours or - NEW FLASH! - make sure you have enough inventory on hand to fulfill your business promises. Seattle is a very competitive food market and my guess is that if Paseo doesn't bring their service up to the same level as their food, eventually their business with notably suffer. I, for one, am not going to Paseo anymore nor will I recommend it to others, either."
1912313,"Awesome old school drive in. Burgers, fries, and shakes; what more can you ask for? It was cold when we got here, so their fireplace was a nice feature. Service was quick and the food was good."
212363,"Kristin and I came here a loooong time ago when they first opened, and from that point forward I knew this would likely be my go-to Thai place in Bellevue. Good prices, large portions, delicious food -- Rice 'n Spice has it all. Sadly for me, I can't often convince my boyfriend to eat Thai food, so I haven't gotten to go nearly as often as I'd like.

I don't often eat noodles (at any restaurant) and Rice 'n Spice is no exception -- I'm sure their pad se ew and pad thai are good, but noodles just aren't my thing. In the past, I've stuck primarily to their swimming rama, which has a ton of veggies and is super tasty, with a flavorful peanut sauce [that I always order at maximum spice]. A few years ago I had a bad experience at another restaurant concerning pumpkin curry, so I've been avoiding it. After a few visits to RnS, I decided I trusted them enough to take the plunge again...

I'm so happy I did.

The kabocha curry at Rice 'n Spice is DIVINE. As in, eat it every day [for multiple meals, even] divine. Every time I eat it, I plan my next return trip -- yes, it's that good. I just had half of a dinner portion for lunch, and I'm already salivating with the thought of my leftovers for dinner [6.5 hours 'til my dinner break at work, it's too far away to stuff myself with delicious curry!]... Now that I'm working nights I look forward to more visits to RnS [boyfriend has a day job, so he can't look down on me if I eat Thai food 3 days a week.... I hope...] :3"
1955159,"Friend who spent his first 23 years in Philly brought me here. LORDZ and GODZ almighty. Got there at 11:15 and there was a line wrapped around the deli. When we left, it was even longer. DAYAMN. This is, easily, the best east coast style gigant-a-sandwich place I've ever been to."
876618,Best burger I've had. The beef they use is unlike anything else ive ever had and the combinations of ingredients all compliment each other very well for all the burgers they make. Basically anything on the menu is good
825785,"MMMM!!  My husband and I went to Barking Frog during Dine Around Seattle and did the 3 course meal for $30.  For the appetizer, I had the beet salad, which was amazing.  My husband had the prawns, which were just OK.  For the entree, I had the Yukon Agnolotti (which I didn't even know what the hell it was, but figured I couldn't go wrong in this place), and it was SO delicious!!  My husband actually liked it better than his Steelhead.  Then I had the Beet cake for dessert and this was incredible!  Chocolate cake topped with some kind of greek frozen yogurt and a giant crunchy chocolate cracker thingy with this tart/chocolatey sauce.  MMM! I wanted to lick the plate!!  My husband had the Apple dessert.  He thought it was really good but he loves apple desserts,  I don't really care for them.  Our waiter was really nice.  Our only mistake was ordering half bottle of wine. . . because then wanted more, so we ordered another half bottle!!  Would have been cheaper to just order a full bottle!"
929651,"Great food, great service, and great ambience!

Definitely a special occasion type of place with the prices, but you get what you pay for- a wonderful meal.

Had some amazing mushroom pasta with locally foraged mushrooms. Yum!"
1790928,"Fabulous meal. A long wait, but fit in a little shopping at Evo and a delightful cocktail at Joule while we waited. My only complaint is that I wanted to try more of the menu but got too full. Already planning another trip back."
824390,"Nice little sushi spot. The sushi is okay, but they serve it a little warmer then I prefer. The service is good, and the seating and atmosphere are comfortable."
34088,"This is a solid spot for this neighborhood. Come in for a beautiful view, full bar, great Happy Hour and Trivia nights. The space is very large making this great for groups. The service is always friendly and the food comes out quickly. Perfect spot for a business lunch. 

Nothing too impressive here food wise. Straight forward, step up from a bar type food. I do really love their Mediterranean wrap on their lunch menu and their burgers are pretty bomb. 

This is an easy, straight forward, casual spot - no amazing good items but nothing bad either. Standard fare."
1911578,"Library Bistro is a gorgeous restaurant. I would recommend the cheese and meats but not the plates. Our Cobb had a very overlooked egg and the tartare lacked salt. Overall, our dishes were slightly unbalanced in some way (except the Croque Madame which was AMAZING.) I adored my coffee, though, which was lovely to sip amongst the books."
918616,Great Pho! My colleagues from Mor Furniture and I order from this place practically every day and never been dissatisfied. Highly recommend!!!
843781,"Best. Restaurant. In. Vancouver. 

Hands down. Awesome service. Amazing service and always delicious food!"
885979,"So I was with my friend here as we just walked across the street from Paseo, who had a huge line and I'm not so in love with Paseo that I'd wait outside, in the Seattle rain for one of their sandwiches. Sorry Paseo but you're no longer the best sandwich in town.
I rarely think to give a 5th star. You must blow my mind. You must do this as soon as I walk through the door and keep doing it long after I have left. Congratulations Dot's, you did just that.  As soon as I walked in and saw the BEAUTIFUL cuts of meat and carefully crafted sausages displayed almost artfully in the case and smelled whatever I was smelling and then was greeted by a super pretty girl from behind the counter in glasses, I was impressed.
Wow I can get a sandwich made with THAT AMAZING meat for $9?! Are you KIDDING ME?!
My friend and I ordered- for him: the days special, a waffle sandwich with pork belly, egg and maple syrup. For me: the spicy pork sandwich and after consulting with my husband over the phone I ordered a porchetta sandwich for him. We ordered this AND I also ordered 5 slices each of mortadella and spicy coppa to sample while we waited ( I couldn't wait to try all that I was looking at!.) So for my 2 sandwiches and our meat sampler it was $22 I think. Not bad at all, considering I would imagine those few slices would have easily gone for $12 anywhere else. I turn to see we beat the line here *phew* 
The mortadella -buttery smooth and just salty enough. I will be back for this as soon as I can!!
The Coppa- very fatty and flavorful, I wish I had bread to put it on.

When we got home we all sat down together and dug in. All three of us just kept ""'MmMMMMM!""ing and ""OH MUH GAHD"" ing though mouthfuls of the best meaty sandwiches we've ever had. Each one of us handing over our sandwiches for bite shares. Each bite -ROLL YOUR EYES IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD GOOD!

I cry to think I am not eating it now. I almost cried when I was done with my sandwich that day.

I will wait in line in the Seattle rain for another one of these sandwiches...I will.

I was sad to be finished.
5 stars to Dot's.
5 stars as you'll haunt my dreams. 
5 stars for being the best of the best. You're as good as Salumi and in my neighborhood."
843667,"The food was good and the ambiance wonderful. It reminds me of Cheers.  Another place that uses the local veggies, fruit and fish.  Wonderful food. 

Caveat:  you will need a breathalyzer test after you eat the bread pudding!   One of the best I've ever had."
2162951,"My friend and I walked here after hearing that this place serves the best slice of coconut cream pie. It was busy when we got there and the hostesses were so nice to let us sit in the corner of the bar and let us order our pie from there instead of waiting on a table. We only wanted that pie and it was so damn good!!! 

Coconut Cream Pie. Get some."
854900,"Went for dinner and another time for breakfast, this place was crowded both times! They have some of the best fried chicken in the area. People say Ezell's is good, but this place is by far way better. There breakfast menu has some really good options on it, and is offered all day. They don't have chicken & waffles, oh well the chicken is still great! They seem to give corn cakes with everything, and they are very addicting. The staff is very friendly and the place has a down south homey feel to it. Oh, and the peach cobbler really is award winning!! I'm definitely putting this place in my bookmarks!"
1790095,Sweet and sour shrimp is so good! This is my go to delivery place for great chinese food. Theyre usually pretty fast and they bring sodas too. I always get the shirmp fried rice...
935391,"Great food for what it is, calm down Queen Anne... It's a fun place for the locals to relax, grab some cheap food and good beer. They don't try to be anything more than they are and you have to respect that."
2151779,"Do the tour!  It's a dollar and you get five tastings of beer AND you get to keep the tasting glass. 

Our tour guide was hilarious.  My cheeks hurt from laughing so much.  I actually learned a lot too.  

You don't actually tour the facilities ... you mostly stand in a viewing room ... but it was still a lot of fun."
867307,"We went here after meandering around Fremont! We ordered a lamb burger with dragon sauce, the seafood burger (blanking on the sauce and real name) and a couple of beers. 

The beer list is extensive and I didn't recognize anything BUT our server was an absolutely amazing and helped us get a beer and knew everything about what they had. 

Food was absolutely amazing!!! All the plates had large portions, were served with fast service and everything was f@$king delicious. We didn't get the nighttime experience but it looks like a place for a more experienced drinking crowd.  

Bottom line is this place was great, service was awesome and we enjoyed lunch. I hope to go back for lunch again!"
1786181,"I ordered the brisket & 2 sides, and left very, very happy. The brisket was quite possibly the best brisket I've ever had in my life. The only problem was that I couldn't fit anymore in my stomach... (haha) Seriously, it was amazing.

For sides, I got the corn on the cob & bakes beans. The beans were...ok. The corn on the cob was fantastic - again, some of the best I've ever had.

The ambiance was great. The staff was very friendly & down to earth. 

I would definitely recommend Bitterroot to anybody."
1638528,"Reminds me a lot of Grammercy Tavern- service was on point. A lot of attention is given to every single detail.

It's definitely a fine dining joint- I'm not a fan of the mandatory/encourage jacket to eat policy but it's @ Canlis. So I wore a suit...

The food was executed well.. But it's as unimpressive as a fine dining meal can get. I had hamachi two ways- with apple and while decent - really didn't highlight any of the components. 

Had wagyu- and it was a slab of meat with some meager sides- plating was un-imaginative if not old - 

Wife had Cod!? And was similarly underwhelming- overall the food was okay but nothing to write home about...

Dessert was again- poor mans Eleven Madison Park... Nothing stood out except maybe puff rice in my wife's dessert..

Overall- it's a good restaurant who's clientele might be dictating their menu- it's unapologetic old school- excellent service, but the Food is dated ..."
810811,"This is the best curry in town! And there are a TON of curry in this town!

The service is freak'n stupid SLOW each time I go there. SLOWer than a plotless movie at an art festival. 

BUT the food is so wonderful!  One of my favorite places in the Olympia/Lacey/Tumwater area."
858815,"I appreciate a place that always has a local porter on tap, even at the end of a really muggy August.  I opted for cider tonight, and it was equally delicious.  We shared the steak sandwich, which was also tasty.  Let me clarify.  By ""tasty"" I mean: I finished my half in mere seconds and wondered why I hadn't ordered a full one.

So why 3 stars?
Two reasons:
1.  My partner had gumbo that was way, way too spicy.  After he finished the cup, I could see nearly a dozen red pepper flakes lining the cup.  We have no idea how many ended up in his tummy.  He was a trooper through it, but he was visibly uncomfortable for some time.
2.  No french fries or dessert.  I get it; for many people, beer IS dessert.  Would have been nice, though."
1313200,"Absolutely amazing food, service and coffee. They're food is so fresh and probably the best I've ever eaten. Just there for Valentine's dinner and had a fabulous 5 course meal. Couldn't have been better! Michelle is an amazing server and made our evening memorable. Even the cute couple next to us was enjoyable. Great night for sure. Thinking this is going to be a regular spot for us!"
743613,"Reasonable prices, good food, and licorice milkshakes. this place gets all my stars"
2195463,"Cute study spot, with free wifi and lots of unique comfy looking couches and tables! Not sure how crowded it can get during the school year, but in August it's nice and empty and relaxing. would definitely study here again.
Drinks here are reasonably priced and well-made. Not your super-gourmet coffee shop, but my mocha did the trick!"
775006,"Purple is one of our favourite places in Seattle.  We always try some the cheeses, and we really like the food, but we seem to go there most often for before/after show drinks.  Love the bar, both upstairs and downstairs."
888307,"Tried it once on Christmas day and loved it. Can't wait to go back. 

I would recommend the buffet for your first visit if you don't know what to order. It's $18 per person, with 1.5 hours dining time limit. See photos to find buffet menu. I didn't really like the ""Pay-Condiments"" (Paid? I know.) so I wouldn't waste money on those again.

There are a lot of vegetarian selections such as vegetables and tofu. However, check with the restaurant to see what's in their soup base.

Even if you like spicy food, I would still suggest you get the Half & Half Soup base. This is because the leafy greens or frozen/fried tofu will catch a lot more spicy oil and juice than you would normally get.

Make sure the meats and fish/meat balls are cooked thoroughly. It takes a while to cook the meat/fish balls so dump them in the pot first. They will float once cooked. I loved the shrimp balls, by the way.

If you are a meat eater, you definitely need to try the lamb shoulder slices. Don't overcook it, though. It kind of floats away with the boiling soup so you have to watch it closely. As soon as it loses the raw redness, it's good to eat.

I can't say much about the service. The service could have been more friendlier. I really just care about the food so it wasn't a bit deal for me.

Also, this is the first Hot Pot place I've visited in the area so I can't say it's THE best but I'm going to be a regular until I find a better one. :)"
1938695,"I really like this place. I liked the food, the presentation was beautiful, the atmosphere was relaxed, and the decorations were pretty. The server did not bother us too much, which I liked, because I find it disruptive if they ask how we're doing every 5 minutes. I wouldn't give it 5 because I don't think they had a huge variety of Thai curries, at least for what I'm used to, and the place was very small. I don't like places where the door is easy to see from the entrance, or you could feel the cold. Many places can avoid this by the right atmosphere, but sometimes it's hard to do. 

Okay so...the reason I wrote this review is because I ordered a chocolate cake with ice cream, can't remember the exact title, AND IT WAS THE BEST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. Something about that cake was moist and perfectly flavored, and the two ice creams (coconut and mango, I believe??) were soooo good with it. & trust me, I've had my share of brownies/cakes/cookies on ice cream. I ordered it first because that's my habit. End review.

Edit: I had no idea there was a 2nd floor. LOL."
1340336,"Lovely little cafe with a fairly overwhelming tea selection. Luckily, the employees were really helpful and made a bunch of suggestions. We ended up with some sort of lemony oolong tea, and a bunch of pastries, and spent maybe an hour and a half finishing it all off.

It was a nice place to come and spend a rainy afternoon. Maybe next time I'll try a crepe!"
863363,"My new favorite breakfast spot...although next time, we'll go during the breakfast ""happy hour"" as it is on the pricey side. 

I had the pork cheek hash - the waitress did talk me out of it for the Tasso Cakes, saying don't order it just because someone on TV said it's the best breakfast they ever had...however they wound up being out of them...so cheek hash it was and it was wonderful. I look forward to trying the Tasso Cakes!  

Hubby enjoyed the Shrimp Creole and eggs over grits... I didn't think he'd like the grits... however he almost licked his plate clean.  

We'll be back!"
886268,"It's my favorite restaurant in freemont.  

I might give 4.5 stars because their service isn't 5 star though.  I still give them 5 star for the taste and value/money.  Very fresh sushi, big bento set."
922657,"I hate to do this too, I really do. We have been fans of Fritz almost from jump. We aren't beer drinkers, so it's all about the fries for us. Which,  the last two times we've been (the last being this weekend),have been straight up terrible. They were underdone both times - like limp underdone. This very last visit, the soda machine was out of whack and when I mentioned it to the girl working, she looked panicked. Clearly she was trying to get food out fast, which meant fries weren't cooked. They didn't come in a cone, which is minor, but if you are trying to sell yourself as ""European"" and the fries are the star, make sure you at least get those right. We also had chicken tenders which were passable. 

I feel like the original owner isn't there anymore because this never happened on his watch. 

Sad - we won't make this a stop anymore when we are over on the peninsula and I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone else anymore."
840454,"After walking into the place and looking around my expectations were high. Hip, modern aesthetics, health centered image, cheap prices, innovative dishes, a slew of interesting sauces.. I thought I had found my new sushi joint... until I actually ate there. The first bite I took made me realize why the food was so cheap.. not so fresh tasting fish, mushy rice, etc. I ate it because I was hungry. Within an hour I had crazy diarrhea. hmm. The following week I gave them a second chance (maybe it wasn't the sushi that had made me feel sick)  and I ordered the Gaba bowl using their email address for orders. When I arrived at the place 25 mins later, they 'hadn't seen' my order. Ok, fine i can deal with it. Ordered the food and yeah.. small cuts, tons of weird suace that leaves a lasting un fresh taste in my mouth and fish that is not exactly fit for a sashimi plate (yellow tail was straight up funky). Bleh. Sadly I am giving up on the place. I wanted to like it, I really did."
945476,"Family-run business that serves good teriyaki and Mongolian beef at cheap prices. Good enough for me! Sometimes, though, the portion sizes are significantly bigger or smaller. I guess it depends on the cook.

Usually packed with workers during lunchtime, but either barely busy or a ghost town outside of the lunch hour."
1341202,"Came here for happy hour on a Friday night after hearing much about it through friends and the Yelp community.  Even though we had a larger group we were able to get seated right before happy hour ended at 6pm, and allowed to order right before the happy hour cut-off time (6pm).  Service was great the whole time and I really loved the ambiance of the restaurant the most.  Dim lighting, woodsy and warm but still modern and sleek, slight buzz but not nosy or loud.  Definitely a great place for a date or to sit at the bar.

We ordered the fries, mussels, chicken wings, pulled pork sandwich, mini mac, fried chicken sandwich, and two orders of brussel sprouts among the table.  I absolutely loved the brussels and that they were served in a mini cast iron.  The sandwiches were raved about and the fries were crispy and delicious.  The mussels and wings were just okay in my opinion.  We had more than enough food for the table.  Everyone ordered either wine or their spin on the Old Fashioned, which were supposedly really good and the whole bill came to less than $20 per person, which is a great deal for good food and a drink.

Would love to come back for brunch or dinner some time!"
2144384,"I only come here for the Polish foods, particularly the fresh kielbasa and butter lambs at Easter. Good stuff. Someday I'll have to try a sandwich!"
972122,"I have to admit to being confused by people saying that Sushi Kappo Tamura is overpriced.  You don't WANT to eat cheap fish, as to source fish ethically involves eating things that are long line caught (not trawled, which rips up the ocean floor and involves a lot of by-catch).  The chef at SKT is catching his own, or sourcing from responsible vendors that understand the population the fish came from, etc.  Sorry, world, but in 2012, eating seafood (or any responsibly raised meat or produce) shouldn't be cheap.

Righteous ranting aside, the uni sashimi I had on my third visit this past Tuesday may be the best piece of urchin I've ever eaten in my life.  Such a balance of that buttery/metallic/tidal flavor... I feel like I may not be able to eat other uni without feeling disappointment.

The service is warm and guest-centered.  I love the ability to eat delicious fish and shellfish, and not feel like I'm contributing to the demise of an animal's existence as a whole.  Thank you, Sushi Kappo Tamura, for doing what you do so well."
2126135,"Great seafood, classy atmosphere, and great location. Prices are a little steep for what you get though - I would expect to pay a lot for Washington King Crab in Arizona, but not in Washington state. Also, their drinks are completely ridiculously priced for what they are. But other than arguable prices, their food is absolutely great."
1142258,Food is way overpriced and ok. Nothing spectacular....a regular root beer drink is $4.85 & no refills on drinks...well unless the waitress likes you. Don't spend your money here...not worth it.
1815438,"Thrilled to discover this hidden gem of fine dining in oak harbor during an excursion to Home Depot (we recently bought a home on south Whidbey). 

The tapas plate includes bacon wrapped dates, smoked mussels, and manchego cheese: DELICIOUS!!! The wine selection includes our favorite local wines (canoe ridge and holmes harbor).  I also loved the decor and ambiance. 

The goat cheese salad was flavorful but not my favorite. The gnocchi entree with pork confit was rich and perfect for a winter meal. 

We took a piece of white chocolate  cheesecake home to enjoy with a bottle of wine...my other half put it best ""this tastes like a stick of butter""."
923067,"Overall, the food was great, although a couple of the dishes were over-salted.  Unfortunately, after arriving for our reservation on time, we waited for over 30-minutes for a table.  There was no where to sit and since one of our party was having back pain, it was a hard wait to stand in the hall for that long.

We ordered a couple drinks while we were waiting and they weren't on the bill when it came out so we assumed they had given them to us for free for our long wait.

The manager of the restaurant however came over and made a point of explaining that they had not planned on comping us the drinks and usually handle those things with a complimentary dessert.  (Although they hadn't done that).

It was disappointing that they hadn't offered us anything originally and then felt the need to tell us they weren't planning on giving us the drinks."
915287,"I had always heard good things, but wasn't sure about going because the location & exterior didn't seem too flashy or exciting compared to what I am used to (sushi snob).  

Finally gave in & was pleased...and full! The cuts of nigiri are a bit thin, but just get the endless sushi (a friggin' bargain) and all is forgiven."
824194,Love this place!!!  I eat here at least once a week
1754487,"I'll start by saying I'm not a big fan of Olive Garden and this particular visit was forced by late night circumstance.  No matter how many times I eat here and am disappointed, I always give it a fair shake.  Unfortunately, not much has changed since my last visit.  

I ordered the seafood brodetto with the usual salad and breadsticks.  My companions ordered the Tour of Italy and the tortellini appetizer with a side of alfredo sauce for the breadsticks.  Breadsticks, salad...you know what to expect here, nothing new.  The alfredo is good for the breadsticks, no denying that, but I don't think I'd want it all over a plate of pasta.

For my main course, the brodetto, I should have looked up exactly what I ordered because I was not expecting a red seafood stew.  The description of the dish didn't lead me to believe that's what I'd be getting anyway.  It was not incredibly flavorful outside of ""salt"" with a slightly unpleasant fishy taste.  An abundance of minced garlic is tossed in this dish as well, and not in a good way.  The cost is high for a dish of this quality and portion size - $18-19.  On a side note, my companion was highly disappointed with the Tour of Italy.  Tiny portion size for the cost, overcooked pasta, and lasagna that looked like it was from the pan scraps and had no substance/form that could be described in any fashion other than ""blob"".

Service at this particular location remains subpar.  The waitress was clearly flustered.  She had an attitude and was not friendly to begin, and obviously could not read us well enough to know that 2 minutes after sitting down is not a reasonable time to have determined what we were going to eat, let alone even settle in.  It felt like she wanted to turn us over as fast as possible.  She spilled sauce on our table, food came out slow...yikes.  A person sat down next to us who was obviously from out of the country and it was difficult to watch her struggle to serve this person.  Ugh.  Serving requires a certain skill set...not everyone has this skill set.

If you must eat chain Italian, I guess Olive Garden will do but there are plenty of other local establishments where your money will be better spent and appreciated."
803613,"The fam and I came here for Easter brunch and we were pleasantly surprised. The cocktails were awesome, plus, they have bottomless mimosas! 

We started with the fried oysters, which were light, crispy, and delicious, and ended with the apple malasadas. 

In between, we had the saimin, loco moco, and seriously the best eggs benedict I've ever eaten. The hollandaise was perfectly creamy, with a nice hit of acid, and the accompanying potatoes were crispy and addicting.

I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken everyone raves about!"
816912,"If I could give this place a one star, I would. A co-worker and I were looking for the best rated Indian food in West Seattle and Yelp told us to go here.

Ordered two entrees of Butter Chicken during the lunch hour. What followed was some of the most disgusted I've ever been at a restaurant. Over half a dozen times was I forced to pick pieces of bone, sinew, and god knows what out of my chicken dish. It was by FAR the worst quality chicken I've ever eaten.  My co-worker had the some experience I did and said it's one of the worst food experiences she's ever had.

On top of charging us for the Butter Chicken, it's also extra for white rich. I hate Indian places that do this.

I'm a very easy-going patron and do not like to complain. I'm not sure what the proprietors thought they were doing when they served us this trash. Very disappointing. Please take note."
692663,"It was SO yummy!!!! 
I've drived by this place hundreds of times on my way from Kirkland to my best friend's house in Federal Way and I can't believe I've never noticed it. A couple weeks ago we were in the mood for Thai and did a quick Yelp search and VIOLA!, it popped up and we decided to try it. 
I hate broccoli (shocker!) so I had them substitute in carrots and lettuce and it was delicious! Definitely going back here whenever we want Thai.... I might drive down to Federal Way more often just to have some yummy Pad See Ew!"
1922162,Some of the best sushi I've ever had. If you have a chance go here during the holidays. Its quite fun. Try the Mt. Ranier sushi. Small but very busy.
968401,"This is a small place. For lunch with a group of 6, glad one of us had made a reservation. This place was packed!! Service was good for being so busy. Food was very flavorful. Really liked it! It was a little spicier than I asked for (1 star) but it was still delicious."
1774871,"Ok, I'm finally going to do it. After what seems like years of very quiet mental deliberation I have to pull back my initial 4-star rating of my local coffee shop. I am prepared for my house to be to get TP'd by my neighbors. Still I think its worth mentioning that a couple things are ones have been slipping.  In short, it's 18$ for 2 coffees and a few baked items.  And the baked stuff kicks ass...but gluten doesn't wake me up.  Caffeine does.  And it's 10% more than the next guy three blocks north.  The owner is doing too much perhaps and the coffee is interior to uptown, the chai, which I just poured out, is a $5 bland milkbomb.

Irwins went from awesome neighborhood coffeeshop to what feels more like a subsidy.  I want them to make it, but through quality, not sympathy.

TP on neighbors..."
976330,"The food is great but it's overpriced. A hot chocolate, yakisoba & an egg sandwich should not cost $50."
1776589,"I tried to like this place. Part of me still wants to, but I've finally had it with the bizzarre service, sniffy barristas and inability to abide by the posted hours of operation. I live close by, and it's right next to QFC where I shop. I'd love nothing more than a mulled wine nightcap once in a while, but I've had so many bad or weird experiences that I'm done with it. 

Multiple times, I've walked in an hour or so before close and been told they're closed (for drinks or food), and got attitude from the barrista when I asked why. The food is so-so, ingredients seem good, but the end product is nothing special at the price. They brand themselves as a coffee shop, but depending on the phase of the moon (there's no rhyme or reason to it) it's either open seating or not. 

Sometimes it says open seating but you sit down and then get pestered by someone to move, or (even better) they nag you in an accusing tone about ordering food, telling you (when the shop is otherwise EMPTY) that, well, generally the window seats are for groups of people, or people who are eating... but they guess you can sit there anyway ('cuz they're so gracious like that).

I hope this place goes bust, all the employees get sacked, and then somebody opens a real, honest to goodness, straight up coffee shop here. (If you want to know what one looks like, check out Bauhaus in Capitol Hill -- make one like that, I'm here every morning and night). It's the perfect space in the perfect place; it's too good for the people who run it."
1668139,"I didn't check reviews before coming here, as I have had fairly good experiences at Hard Rock (for a chain restaurant).  The service was very good and we had very attentive staff.  It was not overly loud and very clean.  Food came out fast and was really good! The apple cobbler was tasty too."
29545,"We have been trying to visit this place, but last minute reservations are difficult. We finally scored a last minute spot on a Friday night to give it a try.

For being in the market, this place is reasonably hidden away. After opening a non-descript door, you walk down a staircase into a very elegantly decorated and romantically lit dining room. A live band was playing.

There is a new fall menu apparently, and I had the sword fish (fish of the day) and my wife had the pappardelle al ragÃ¹ bolognese. Both dishes were amazing. The drinks were also quite exotic, and since I am a bit adventurous, I found two different cocktails on the menu that I found very enjoyable (don't quiz me on the names!). One made use of a bitter. 

I will definitely have to return, especially on Mondays (trapeze show) or perhaps on Saturday. You may want to plan ahead where you are seated, as the restaurant has two distinct sections that can block your view of whatever is on stage."
1623225,"$20 for breakfast? Are you kidding? That would have been my thought if I had seen the menu without coming here and tasting the food first. Boy am I glad I gave it a shot. It got the traditional breakfast and added on a pancake. The pancake with vanilla mascarpone, was the best pancake I have every had, hands down. Is a single pancake worth $4? I don't know. But if there is one, this is it. The other thing here that stood out was the sausage. Best breakfast sausage I have ever had, bar none. This is really close to 5 stars for me, but the price is pretty steep for breakfast."
984272,Delicious Gyros!! Friendly staff and authentic Greek style! These greeks work hard to do things right!
2145398,"This place has the best breakfast in Seattle. Yeah yeah, pork cheeks confit hash, it's good-- but the eggs benedicts here are the best I've had. They tend to overcook the poached eggs on weekends, I've noticed, but during the week the benedicts are perfect. The veal shallot reduction drizzled along with the hollandaise is divine.

The beignets are not what you'd expect if your only experience with beignets is Cafe du Monde, but these little suckers are pretty damned tasty (the chicory sauce seals the deal).

They're hit-or-miss on dinner, though. I've had quite a few dishes that were wonderful-- the half-chicken, the cajun meatloaf, and some of the pastas-- but NEVER ORDER A STEAK HERE. I'm Texan, so I like my rare steaks rare, but when I asked for a rare ribeye here, I got something which was still cold inside. Not room temperature-- the center was still noticably REFRIGERATED. This is ghastly, not just because a rare steak should be warm throughout (at least 100F), but because that means they don't allow their steaks to equilibrate to room temperature before grilling-- and that's both a crime and a sin. When I brought this to the waitress' attention, she brought me back the same steak-- which had been MICROWAVED.

I will never, ever, ever have dinner here again, which is a shame because their bar has a lot of talent (Ty definitely knows his craft). But it's still my favourite place for breakfast."
1453418,"The fish and chips here is the best I have ever had, and that's why I continue coming back. Homemade tarter sauce really seals the deal, and the fries aren't bad either. Plus they have super cheap PBRs. So it's really a win win. The staff has always been very friendly and the view is not bad either. I really just have no complaints, stop by if some rock solid fish and chips are your thing."
2492479,"This is not a Chinese take-out place... it's a sit-down restaurant. In fact it's a Korean/Chinese restaurant in spite of having a Chinese name!  They have some lunch specials, but they are very pricey. I ordered the chicken lo mein lunch special which came with a choice of different soups. For a lunch special, $9 is a lot and the proportions are really small. Plus the food itself was really bland. I think the white rice had more flavor than the noodles and chicken. I wasn't impressed at all."
160630,"My friends had their rehearsal dinner on the rooftop deck.  Man, was it amazing! 

Terra Plata's MO is that it brings you seasonal inspired food with local growers and artisan producers.  Some of those ingredients can also be found on the roof too. The food was top notch with its creativity, flavor, and attention to detail.  Combine the food with the best rooftop in Seattle (outside of Pike Place Market), then you have one of Seattle's best summer dining experiences."
1048270,"Quite liked all the food ordered.  True Napoli pizza was delicious.  I also ordered the sliced meat platter and that was incredible, especially for the price, which was quite inexpensive for the giant platter received.  We sat at the counter/bar because the place is small and there was nowhere else to be without a wait, which would have had us standing outside in the cold.  Turned out to be a treat because the two guys working the counter were hilarious.  In speaking with the owner, he mentioned that they are probably taking over the space next door, so I look forward to the expansion."
1889692,"Read alot of the bad reviews and really didn't know what to expect - however, was pleasantly surprised when we walked in. Had brunch there on a rainy, Sunday morning. It was warm and welcoming when we walked in. Dimly lit with candles on each table and it smelled wonderful.

The mimosas weren't bad and I enjoyed my cappucino. I loved the Beet and Goat Cheese Eggs Benedict - it was different and delicious.

I'd definitely go again to check out their happy hour or to try many of the other delicious sounding entrees on their brunch menu."
1721677,"Maybe after like 20 beers it tastes like good chili. I had one beer to accompany my chili, this is the worst example of chili I have ever had. Very bland, not much meat, beans were over soaked, squishy blechk. I have heard rumors they don't clean the chili pot, I believe it. I will never return, the high reviews blow me away.   If you want to read something gross check out their inspection results from the King County Public Health Restaurant Inspection Report (how are places like this still in business?)"
1649808,"I always go to Spaghetti Factory when I'm craving pasta.  I always order the same thing - the pot pourri without meat sauce on angel hair pasta.  I can't get over their mizithra cheese & browned butter.  You have to try it.  Also add some crushed red pepper if you like some spice!

Their minestrone soup is consistently good and I love their complementary sourdough bread with garlic butter.  They give you a whole loaf of sourdough bread.  And you can ask for more!

I've also tried a variety of other things in the years I've been coming here, and all have been great as well - the vesuvius, spinach tortellini and crab ravioli.

The service has also been consistently good.  I've always had really friendly servers who are fast and efficient."
785909,"Still love the Oysters, always fresh.
Still love the fish, superb and again, fresh.
Not so happy this last time with the housekeeping or staff.  There were crumbs everywhere and no one made a move to clean anything!  When shown to our table, there was a dirty washcloth on the floor by our booth and I had to mention to the hostess that she may want to pick it up!  A little effort people!  
The food is great, concentrate now on getting some extra staff or training the ones you have to invest a little extra and be proactive in keeping the place clean.
Just my two cents."
2135066,Had breakfast here. Very good and a lot of food. A couple could split one breakfast entree. Nice view of the water. A little pricey.
2168897,"Very satisfied with recommendations of the waiter and the rolls they have, their happy hour menu is small but still pleasing. Definitely go here if you are looking for a hybrid between Umi's and the next best sushi restaurant. Although this is Umi's sister restaurant, Momiji wins. Highly recommended.

Dishes ordered: Geisha roll, calamari, Casino Royale, Lemon Chicken, Seattle crunch, Hello Kitty cocktail"
1105174,"Yes, lasagna was a tricolor phenomenon BUT how is everyone not raving about the LONG RIB!? Not to be mixed up with your average short Rib. Oh, and topped with celery, horseradish, and marcona almonds... Need I say more? Patrick took the experience to a new level with the perfect bottle of Pinot and just the right amount of steering. We left happy and sleepy- hell yeah."
1099290,"I had a really nice dinner here.  I am not giving this a  star rating for ambiance, if you want that kind place choose Stanley and Seaforts, I am giving this place a 5 because of what it offers, where it was and for how much.  Food first, my husband and I both ordered the Salmon and it was very well cooked and presented the au gratin was very good as well and the portion sizes were just right, but definitely not enough for left overs.  On the other hand, my children ordered the halibut and the macaroni and cheese meals and those did provide leftovers.  My husband and I ""sampled"" their food and it was very tasty as well.  I do grow tired of going to places and paying $7 or more for Kraft macaroni, and this was not that.  It was nice and creamy, with chopped  ham bits.  My son had the battered halibut and that was well made, no hard breading and not at all greasy.  They provided the kids with a selection of sides and my kids went with the gargantuan slices of watermelon.  The cocktails were nice, not at all watered down and served in canning jars, nice touch.  The place is very open and indoor seating got us in right away.  I liked the noise level, since I have a 4 and 5 year old.  It was a relief to not have to hush them every three seconds.  I definitely recommend this place for families and my husband and I will be be going back for a casual date night on the water sometime soon!  Thanks!"
784276,"Got the Jack Special and French Onion Soup, and both were superb. Staff was nice, and store was unique in their products. 

The store has a waffle-cone aroma that makes wanting ice cream irresistible. 

All in all, great West Seattle deli, and would definitely return!"
1668917,"Out of towners here, and we went to this place on a whim wile driving around the Fremont area. I had the taco platter, and loved it, my fiancee had the quesadilla, and loved it. The guac was great, good prices, very friendly staff, cool neighborhood; what more do you want?"
1772820,"classic hot pot place, portions were large, food was good, peanut sauce was tasty."
963383,"After three beers tonight I was told I wouldn't be served any more beer until I ordered food. Really?! Ordered a bowl of black bean soup, which I really like here, and another beer. After the soup and beer I ordered another IPA. Was told I was cut off. WTF?! Asked why and the little gal waiting on me launched into a story about a  friend drinking to much and dying in a car crash in Entiat, WA. Good to know folks are looking out for you based on their own personal tragedies, right. I've posted that this place and their food has been declining in the last ten years my visiting Wenatchee. This was the last straw for me. Good luck  McGlinns. You've lost my business forever."
806655,"I've really got to stop buying groupons. Every time I eat somewhere based on a groupon it's a disappointment. This place is ok. As far as a brunch place, it's definetly somewhere to go when your hungover, not a place to take Mom and Dad to when they are in town visiting. The waiter looked about 15 years old at most, but he was a nice kid. Somehow turned the eggs benedict I ordered into an omelette but thankfully the mistake was discovered before the food was made. Not the best eggs benedict I've had. The sauce was really heavy. The scones that come with breakfast are better served as pigeon food. The blueberry pancakes I ordered were ok, but a little thick for my liking. Will I be back to the Scarlet Tree for brunch? No. I might try the place in the evening sometime, especially if they have good music playing. Looked like a cool place to hang out for that reason."
1024295,"It's inexpensive, fast and good.  When I want a gyro, I go here!  Probably my favorite quick food joint in town."
2195028,"This seemed like one of those times where the stars weren't aligned.  A friend and I were aimed for this place, but she got hung up at work and I ended up cancelled our reservs.   Then, she freed herself up and I called asking if we could get a table about an hour later.  The reply, ""Sure, there won't be any problem"".  

After finally landing a parking spot, we waltz up and are told there are no seats to be had.  We are directed to the bar and did manage a couple of seats there.  Unfortunately, there is a ton of traffic up there with people sitting down and moving and deciding if they want to stay or go.  So, the jostling factor is pretty high.

Staff was quick but when it came to our meals, I thought my steak was really poor quality.  I love marbling, but my piece was sinewy and almost impossible to cut through.  I expect a bit of it because I love rare, but it was difficult to eat.  The mashed and veggies were the best thing on the plate.

Maybe this is a better HH place."
793946,"It was a really nice place. The design of the inside was kinda fancy. The girl working was nice and made me a really pretty little latte in a strange fancy cup. What I didn't like was how expensive it was. This isn't downtown Seattle, people!"
2195880,"A nice little breakfast place in Columbia City, with it's heart in the right place

And the food is good too.   Whenever we're in the area, we stop there for breakfast.  There's often a queue, but it moves quickly.  You can tell that the folks in the neighborhood love this place - and for good reason.

Standard breakfast fare with quality ingredients and a bit of a southern flair.  Local suppliers, often organic, for most items.  Well worth a trip.

Not good for parties larger than 4 or 5 (4-person booths and tables).  And they do serve meals other than breakfast -- but breakfast is their forte."
1447567,I love the happy hour here! Yummy bloody marys and blue cheese fries. Hello!!! and if you go here for dinner I recommend the mussels. They are deliouse.
1823654,"Stopped here with some girls yesterday for a quick lunch and we were craving mexican. I had always driven by this place wanting to try it, since I am a fan of Chowfoods restaurants, and now was finally the time!

After browsing the menu I saw at least 5 things I wanted to try, but I was in the mood for comfort food and wanted to play it safe at a new place, so I ordered the cheese quesadilla w/ pico di gallo and a side of rice and beans. In addition, I got a side of sour cream, and some of their chipotle salsa.

The quesadilla was cooked to perfection! The salsas were amazing, I definitely wanted to try the Avocado Crema in addition to others on their salsa menu, but didn't want to be THAT GIRL with 10 dipping sauces in front of her. Definitely branching out next time. The beans tasted great with some cojita cheese. The rice was okay, not the biggest fan of whatever seasoning they were using on it.

Definitely going back and bringing my boyfriend to try the Carne Asada tacos and enjoy a few beers. So glad we tried this place :)"
2154984,"Pros: Excellent dumplings
Cons: Terrible service, rude employees that make you feel like an intruder and inconvenience 

I was excited to dine here after hearing great reviews about the juicy dumplings. The dumplings were superb, but if I came back I would only get them to-go. The service was atrocious and made me feel incredibly disrespected as a customer and a person. Additionally, part of our order never came out, despite asking many times. We finally canceled the order out of frustration. 

One of the diners at my table also found a hair cooked into the noodle dish they ordered. They promptly presented it to the wait staff. While they eventually (after a 20 minute wait) brought a new dish, they refused to remove the cost of the dish from the bill, even when we discussed the issue with Sam, the manager. Sam certainly led by example, in a very negative manner, when it came to the attitude at which he treated customers. This was obvious in many instances. 

In summary, the food was great, but I'm sure you can find similar cuisine elsewhere without leaving feeling angry, frustrated and disrespected."
2605841,"I go to school in Belltown and I'm a downtown local. Still one of my favorite bars on Planet Earth!! The only other rival it has in my book of life is in a small Island in Thailand's golden coast (but you probably have to wear shoes and a shirt in this one,) so yea, good, very good. They still have an Incredibly friendly staff, great mixed drinks and a fantastical happy hour...yes, I said fantastical. The only thing it lacked: T.Vs. There was only one in the bar area and none in the back so it wasn't the most ideal for the games :( Problem fixed!! Thanks guys!! They put two new ones up so I could watch the Seahawks mop the floor with the 49ers anywhere I stood!!! Gona party till she ship sinks here for the superbowl!! GO SEAHAWKS!!!!"
1084733,"We visited Jones for the first time tonight. We had a Groupon, which is always great, and took my parents who are visiting from Ohio. What a nice surprise! The place was open, clean, and comfortable. Parking is pretty easy with the $1 lot across the street. The woman who helped us, was awesome! So sweet and patient with all of us while we decided what to order. We all ended up getting the rib tips special for 12.95. Waaayyy too much food for everyone to finish, and ended up taking some home.  We all liked our food, and already know what we will order next time. 
The only problem...was us. As we all cleared the table, and talked about what a great place it was and how nice the lady was....we forgot to leave a tip, and just realized so! We will be stopping by tomorrow to drop off our tip to her. We feel awful!"
1029309,"Really good food! We love their brisket, pork, and baked beans. However it is over priced for the amount of food you get. That is the only downside...
Oh and they make the BEST pecan bars!"
835642,"This review is about service. The food was so-so which is why it got 2-stars. The service however, is a different story.  Starts of with waiting 20 minutes for a table even though they didn't look that busy, but a pass on that since it was up front on the 20 minutes.  If only it was that, 15 min in the wait, we are asked if it would be OK to sit outside, otherwise it would be 20 min.  I asked if their was shade, was told their was plenty, LIES, half our party was in the sun with no shade.  Then it took 10 minutes to get drinks ordered, ordered mind you not get them.  5 minutes later we get them although she wasn't sure which was diet and I was told to smell it to make sure... OK, then we order and the appetizers came out with the food, odd right. The whole feeling is that we were forgot about and she only came out when she had to.  No offers for refills on drinks or fries, no real service.  They final was when she asked, ""You guys getting desert... no, well here's your bill."" Not from here so i don't have to worry about going back, but is it just me or have Red Robins gone downhill no matter what location?"
2195458,"My first cafe love, and it's still going strong :) 

I love the atmosphere, the service, and the food! I haven't been there since it's been remodeled (is that finished yet?) because they kept pushing back the date... I hope that it hasn't changed too much, although I wouldn't mind a bit more elbow room between all the tables. 

Anyways, their bulgogi sub is great. So is their BLT. I didn't care much for the pumpkin lentil soup, but that's probably only because I dislike vegetables :P"
218270,"It was a sunny day. 

It was a sunny day, full of good intentions.

It was a sunny day, full of good intentions that ended up here.

Originally, my boyfriend and I were going to go to Eastlake Bar & Grill to enjoy part of the aforementioned day on the deck with a gorgeous view. However, we failed to factor in the horrible parking situation that ensues when everyone else decides to enjoy their sunny day on the deck, too. 

So we cancelled the reservations and started driving around, looking for somewhere else to eat. After much frustration, we just decided on Beppos. We parked and hiked over to Beppos, only to find out that it's prom season. Dang! Nevermind. 

Back outside, we both went straight for the Yelp app for some help. He prevailed (as usual) with a destination, and I followed my handsome leader. 

We arrived at re:public and were offered the last open table. Score! I was very impressed with its dÃ©cor and how it was open yet cozy in the small space it has. 

I was stuck between a few options, but the number one contender was the shrimp + grits. Unfortunately, I am lactose intolerant and had forgotten my lactaid pills in the car. (Poor thing was parked 20 minutes away at this point...) Soooooooooo I had to trash the thought of grits and creamy sautÃ©ed shrimp. Damn!

I ended up ordering the pappardelle and beef cheek. It was alright--tender and tasted homemade... but it wasn't what I was dreaming of. Boo.

We also started off with the chicken sweetbreads + dipping sauce. They looked amazing! Perfectly golden fried chicken balls. The sauce? Fantastic. Wait. This doesn't feel or taste right. Hold on. This is neither bread nor chicken. I... don't... know... what... I'm... eating. 

Oh Lord.

I googled it and we learned that chicken sweetbreads were, indeed, neither chicken meat nor bread. (Or at least ""normal"" chicken meat.)

Aside from the fact that now I can say that I've tried sweetbreads, this place was a great spot to end up at on a sunny Saturday evening. Nice noise level, very attentive server, great dÃ©cor, and I liked the unique location.

Oh, and the butter for the house bread... BEST. I'VE. EVER. HAD."
1966167,"I've ordered delivery from them 5 times now,  and the order has always been right(knock on wood), and the food tastes great and is reasonably priced, and delivery usually doesn't take to long. Definitely recommend giving this place a shot!"
863345,"Wonderful assortment of Absinthe.  Good food, good atmosphere.  It is usually packed, so at night, I would recommend getting a reservation.  Overall, good place and will be back"
879275,Great food - try the clams! Also had the Dungeness Crab Mac N Cheese which was delicious. The patio is great people watching and has a beautiful view. Waitress was also helpful and provided good service.
692616,"We came here last night for our anniversary and everything was perfect. Possibly the only thing we had any sort of issue with was it was a little hard to tell who worked there since everyone is wearing casual street clothes. But once we figured it out it just added to the comfortable, relaxed atmosphere that this place is trying to convey. 21+ only was really nice for a romantic evening. 

Even though the place was packed, we got a table quickly enough after a short wait at the bar and our waiter was perfectly attentive without being overbearing. I had a peach blossom cocktail and loved that the bartender also gives you the shaker. You feel like you're actually getting your money's worth. 

We were quite hungry and tempted to order 5 dishes but our super helpful waiter suggested we start with 4. He was absolutely right. 4 was just right. The plates arrived very quickly. I was anticipating more of a wait but the kitchen was whipping them out at a breakneck pace. 

We ordered:

1/2 dozen oysters. My husband didn't care for the mignoinette but I thought it was perfect. I was craving oysters and these were so sweet and yummy. 

Bacon wrapped Scallops with Frizzled Kale. I loved this, possibly my favorite dish of the evening. The scallops were perfect and I could've easily eaten a plate of that kale on its own. 

Lamb Meatballs with Paneer. My husband's favorite. The meatballs were super tasty with a little harissa kick, the paneer was hot and flavorful plus there was a ton of fresh tzatziki and tabbouleh to cool things off. 

Wild Boar Ribs. Unbelievably tender. A little dry and while I enjoyed the intense smokiness while eating them, I was still tasting it hours later. 

We had a  movie to catch otherwise we probably would've ordered dessert. I was curious about the Earl Gray Panna cotta.  Next time! There will be a next time for sure. So many other gorgeous little nibblies that I have to try. Looking forward to trying their happy hour."
2152567,Some of the best sushi I've had anywhere.  Great atmosphere.  Sit at the sushi bar!
1155122,"I really like the food at Le Reve, the ambiance and the staff.  But I am writing to say that not only do I object to the allowing of non-service animals inside the restaurant, I also want the owner to be keenly aware that it is breaking the law in Seattle to do so.  Hence, the low-star rating.

My friends and I were having lunch yesterday, Oct. 30, when we saw two women take a seat inside the eatery, along with a dog.  One of them was holding the dog in her arms, but, at intervals along the way, the dog sat down on one of the chairs, as well as briefly putting its paws on the tabletop.

We assumed that a staff member would politely inform them that the dog was not allowed inside where food was being served, much less actually pawing the table or being allowed to be held in its owner's arms at the table, but, noooooooooooooo.  Instead, the woman holding the dog went to a counter where food and drinks are routinely in proximity and gave a food staffer her order - all the while holding the dog in her arms in clear view of the employee and standing near the order counter.  Soon, she and her dining companion - with the dog in arms - ate their lunch with the casual air of the, oh, so, unconcerned. And the next customers who walked in and took that table had no idea what had just taken place where they were getting ready to eat.

Let me be clear:  I am an animal lover, especially dogs.  But there are sensible reasons as to why Seattle city codes do not allow non-service animals in places where food is served.  Not only is it a matter of hygiene and health, but also the  possibility that a patron, especially a child, could be bitten by an animal.  Moreover, who wants to put up with possibly ill-behaved dogs, including barking, snarling or fighting with other canines that could also, presumably, be allowed entrance at Le Reve?

And, trust me, if the owner allows one non-service animal inside then other dog owners will follow suit, sooner or later.  Here's my advice:  Save yourself from a fine, unhappy customers, and a potentially litigious situation if anyone is harmed or becomes ill.  And it is misleading to the public on your Yelp page to annotate that dogs are allowed.  You do not have the right to summarily declare yourself exempt, so to speak, from laws that others are required to follow.

I Googled a police and crime blog published online by the Seattle PI called Seattle 911.  One of the questions asked on the site is: ""Is it legal to bring dogs into a (Seattle) restaurant or bar?""

The answer:  ""The simple answer is 'no,' except for service animals,"" according to David Gifford of the State Department of Health.

Chapter 246-215 of the Washington Administrative Code was cited as the source for the laws regulating this topic.

The owner of a Washington restaurant or bar that serves food and allows non-service dogs inside are not only subject to fines, the code also allows for closure for disobeying the animal regulations.

We live in Queen Anne.  Your restaurant is so welcome here.  Please consider that many people who share my feelings will not take the time to write.  They will just move on."
916591,"I can't say enough great things about this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to take a weekend away to Port Angeles, and heard about Michael's from the guest book of our rented cabin. And boy am I glad we did!

We showed up during the dinner rush on a Saturday night and immediately got a table at the bar, then started the night off with a couple of cocktails (the Don Juan de Fuca is INCREDIBLE). We ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell and the crab/spinach/artichoke dip. WOW. The waitress didn't know what the oysters were for the evening, but she was very quick to find out from the kitchen for us. After we polished off the apps, I enjoyed the steak and crab while my boyfriend had the steak and lobster. Very reasonably priced, the portions were more then generous, and my steak was cooked to perfection (I'm picky about my steak, too!). I wasn't able to finish my meal, but the leftovers made a fantastic breakfast the next morning. :) We didn't have room for dessert, so had a couple of dessert cocktails instead...I highly recommend the peppermint patty. All in all it was a fantastic night with great service and ambiance. In fact, we enjoyed it so much that we decided to come back for a second night in a row! This time we decided to just try out an array of appetizers rather than go for the full dinner option; we ordered the duck flat bread, crab cake, brussel sprouts (there were on special that evening) and brie. Everything was fantastic, but OH THE BRIE. It was good enough to have for dessert, and Michael (our server for the evening) was kind enough to bring it to us last. In fact, he staggered all of our appetizers so we could enjoy them all, rather than have them all arrive at the table at once.

Honestly folks, I know this restaurant has gotten a few less-than-stellar reviews, but I don't understand why. This isn't the kind of restaurant where one should expect to be in and out in less than an hour, it is a place to relax and enjoy truly well prepared food and drinks. We are from Seattle and have a plethora of restaurants to choose from over here, and I still think this one ranks in my top 10 (once you factor the price value in, it quickly jumps up to top 5). I would highly recommend it for a night when you have some free time to sit back, relax, and enjoy being spoiled."
2155083,"The wait is Awful. Capital A. However, the food makes up for it. I love this place, and probably go about once a week now.... its delicious.

nom nom nom =]"
694280,Pretty good Thai food.  The Pad Thai was very good and the curry chicken was decent.  The servers were polite and food was served quickly.
774300,"Happened on this place using the app (as usual) and ate a great meal for lunch (as usual, see aforementioned app). Win!

I'm in Greenwood randomly and needed a tasty and semi-healthy lunch. My wife's awesome leftovers were at home but I wasn't so I needed something that would hold up to the test of my discerning, though rarely picky, taste buds. This place nailed it. 

I had a chicken schawerma (I've seen that word spelled 25 different ways, including 2 in this restaurant), their recommendation, with some of their sambal-like (though not as hot) sauce. Chicken was seasoned just right, pita was soft and warm, sauce level was perfect (not dry but not squirting everywhere) ... I couldn't have made it better myself. Well, that's not saying much, I probably couldn't make this if I tried. 

I've had doners, kebabs, and shawarmas the world around and this place holds up to comparison. If this is your type of food, you'd be foolish to pass these guys up."
1656689,"They ruined our Valentine's Day dinner. I want to say that we were so excited about going to this place for Valentine's Day. We had been once before and really enjoyed ourselves, so I made reservations a week out. When we got there for our 7 pm reservation , we were forced to stand in a crowd inside the door for over half an hour before we were finally seated. There was no organization, people were just randomly being seated, almost in a ""whoever makes the most fuss"" sort of way, despite everyone having given their names. One couple was told they were next (and had been waiting for over an hour!) and I saw 4 other couples seated before them. 

Anyway, we finally made it to a table and it was dirty! (pic posted) They did not clean the table for at least 15 minutes. Looking around, we saw that others were suffering the same fate. There was one staff person running around confused, clearing tables for those that made a fuss. When the previous diners dishes were finally removed, we decided to roll up our dirty table cloth so that he would notice us. We did this, because the couple at the next table were actually served water on their dirty table and had to point it out. We were taking no chances. 

Finally, the waiter replace our rolled up, dirty table cloth for a fresh one and tossed some silverware and one napkin on our table. It was sort of assembly line style. Walk out with clean cloths, put them on 4 tables. Return with a handful of silver, toss them on each table. Walk out with napkins, some get them, some don't. So... We arranged our own silverware and my husband let me have the napkin. How romantic! During this, several couples were just walking out, fed up. We decided to laugh and make the best of it, since there was no way we would get in anywhere else on this short of notice. 

After about 20 minutes of sitting there, we each were grateful to receive a small wine glass of water and one menu. We never were offered any wine list or any thing else to drink. We watched one couple actually open their own wine bottle and pour it themselves. We were shocked to find out that they had only a special Valentine's day menu available. (THIS WAS NOT ON THE WEBSITE OR POSTED!) Another couple left at this point for this reason. When we finally flagged down the waiter (the guy clearing tables), we confirmed that the 3 entrees listed were all that was available. The kicker? They were charging $49 per person. No options. Still we stayed. 

I ordered the soup and the pear gorgonzola ravioli, my only option. My husband ordered the salad and the salmon. A few minutes later they waiter came out carrying about 5 plates of the appetizer (caprese) and dropped one in the middle of each table. No appetizer plates, my husband still did not have a napkin, and our water was empty. We ate off the same plate and were thankful to at least be chewing at this point as it was after 8.  Another 15-20 minutes later and the waiter showed up with 2 salads. I corrected him and asked for my soup. It came out cold, after my husband had completed his salad.  It was inedible.

Finally our dinner arrived. At this point I was about to cry. The laughter was gone. My anticipated Valentines dinner was cold ravioli, (about 7 pieces) thrown on a plate with a piece of pear. It was so sugary I could not eat it. The ravioli was so chewy! I took one bite and just pushed my plate away. To be fair, my husband said his salmon was good. Though the potatoes and veggies on his plate were cold and rubbery. I told the waiter about it and he just cleared my plate and walked away. No offer of anything else.

At this point, we joined the pack headed for the door. I was so disappointed. I tried to talk to someone about our ticket or to complain, but no one would give us time of day. We ended up just leaving without paying. 

I cannot tell you how awful it was, but I have tried. I will never go back. I will be broadcasting to all who will listen to not go there for Valentine's Day. This is a special evening that should be enjoyed. We chose to enjoy it at a nice restaurant in a romantic setting. Andiamos turned our romantic dinner into a circus show. I am so disappointed. We ended up eating at Denny's. Shame on them."
822954,"There are more sanitary options.  

The last time I visited I ordered two tofu spring rolls.  I ordered at the register with a girl who was accepting money.  Without washing her hands or putting on gloves, she reached into a plastic container and began packaging the spring rolls in a Ziploc bag.  I said nevermind and left.  Not only is this disgusting, it is a health code violation.

Well, after some time and apparently a glutton for punishment, I went back.  This time the person at the counter (perhaps the owner?), again cashiering, opened the plastic container and appeared as though he was going to handle the food items.  I asked him to put on gloves.  He was shocked I had such a request, tossed an already packaged zip lock bag AT me and muttered something about the fact that he always wears gloves.  I told him the last time I was there, I experienced someone handling food without washing or wearing gloves.  He went silent.  He didn't say anything such as, ""I'm sorry that was your experience, it is not up to our standards"" or ""I will ensure that doesn't happen again"".  He didn't acknowledge it at all.  He just hurried me out so he didn't have to deal with me anymore.  
I was not rude or mean, I simply asked him to handle my food in a sanitary manner.  Needless to say it was uncomfortable and I was very uncomfortable.  I did pay for the food and left; however, I did not end up consuiming it.

Overall, they seem to have very low standards in both food handling and customer service.  I will most definitely NOT be returning to PHO Cycle CafÃ© - ever."
2144298,"Hands down to best pork sandwich I have EVER had and, well - I've eaten a LOT of pork sandwiches.  The aroma of the perfectly put together sandwich is enough to send you into complete euphoria...and take a bite and forget it.  HEAVEN.  Pork heaven paired with perfectly caramelized onions, jalapenos drenched in a garlic aioli, crisp romaine and a crisp-yet-soft-yet-buttery-yet-salty baguette to hold it all together for my personal devour.  

The only issue I had was that it got a little messy towards the end of the hooverization.  But really, flavor is all that really matters in the end so I stick to my 5 star rting.  I'll take a few drips of pork heaven on my shirt for the whole day, a juicy smear across my face as a delicious reminder, hands slathered with aioli and jalapeno spiciness.  All I ask is that this pork sandwich continues to fill my belly at least once a month (OK sometimes more--I'm not ashamed).

I love you Paseo.  Oh how I love you."
1943719,"I actually found this place on Yelp! and it was during the weekdays in the morning so not too many people are in the restaurant but this place is very good, hearty portions at a very fair price! as everything is made fresh off the skillet

As many people mentioned the ambiance is definitely very down to earth and a small quiet place despite Leary Way is a busy street.

I would definitely recommend the Scone as they are very large and fluffy"
863651,"If you've only gone for brunch, try it for dinner!  I prefer VPC's dinner rather than brunch, which is always too busy for my liking.  I don't know why I've never reviewed this yet since it's my favorite restaurant of all time.  The staff, the food, the cozy atmosphere- it's all wonderful, and this hasn't changed over the past five years that I've been going, no matter who's working there.   In my approximately one zillion visits, I've had pretty much everything on every dinner menu/special menu they've ever had.  In all those zillion times, there was only once or twice that one of the plates I ordered was less than 5 stars.  I was going to list my favorites, but then I had written everything on the menu, so let's just say that my favorite is the dinner menu.

It's also a great place just to go for desserts, which are incredible (salted caramel tart and bread pudding made with chocolate croissants are my two favs).

Great spot for a romantic evening or a dinner with friends.  I've brought many out of town friends here, and they all still talk about what a wonderful experience they had."
1905682,Place is great. Good service and staff knows how to keep their customers entertained.
2587327,"This sweet little spot is conveniently located in Thornton Place across from the theater. It's great for pre or post movie beer, wine, snacks or bubble tea. Don't think of a wannabe Starbucks, this place feels genuinely like a hole in the wall Seattle coffee house (in a good way!) Some other gems (hah) about the Jewel Cafe:

+ bubble tea! Sugar free options, too
+ beer and wine
+ breakfast all day! (Tho I haven't tried it yet)
+ Great vibe
+ Friendly staff
+ Cozy
+ good Espresso"
1038245,"Hands down the best Thai food around. A friend recommended this place (thank you Emily)and to be honest if she hadn't I would never have gone. It's located on Pac Hwy and some of the businesses in the area are pretty sketchy. 
The service was awesome, and the food was all ""roll on the ground"" good. We got the crispy chicken since other Yelpers recommended it and it easily lived up to the reviews. The fresh spring rolls were the best I have had and the Thai iced tea was amazing. We can't wait to go back and try other dishes! Oh...the prices are also very reasonable given the quality and quantity of food."
1684480,"I went into the restaurant RIGHT after it opened (within days) because I was excited to try it out.  They have a fairly large restaurant, and at the time, a handful of customers.  

The hostess was really bitchy! She (in a very condescending tone) asked if I had a reservation... Well, no, you just opened, it's 8:30 on a Tuesday evening and you've got 50 open tables... why would I make a reservation?

  She informed me that it would be a 30-45 minute wait for one of the empty, not reserved tables.  Fortunately for shitty planners like myself, there were two seats at the bar.  Thank Jesus they had open seating for me! 

The bartender made this experience a lot better.  He wasn't an ass hole, was super nice and the food was good.  Overall, a good experience, but they really should fire that chick at the door."
812923,"This used to be a place my husband and I enjoyed. Pick and choose, eat as much or as little as you wish, not great, but decent sushi.

Well, looks like Ol' Blue C has added a lot of new items and actual menus. Which could be a good thing, but it's not. There were a bunch of new items on the conveyor that were neither remotely Japanese, nor fresh (*ahem, fruit, desserts *ahem* looked disgusting). BLT sushi? Club sandwich? Cheesecake? Sad looking cupcakes on which the sprinkles were losing their color? I could spend a few bucks at Safeway for that crap.

But the fat cherry on top? The bill. Holy sh**! They no longer have charts up that show what each plate costs, but we just assumed it was as it was before. Not so. $77 before tip for 2 people is not remotely a reasonable price for a sushi lunch--especially when the food is sadly unfresh. And we also ate less than we used to going there. Mainly because things didn't look that enticing. Pretty sure they charged us $6 for 2 small plates of edamame. It's slightly wilted, not so tender, mildly warm soy beans people!

I want my money back so badly. I feel like we could've gone out to two satisfying dinners instead of one so-so lunch."
1343278,"On a cold night, THIS is the best thing to have. They have the most tastiest kimchi which compliments the soup perfectly. I pretty much come here at least twice a month. The service is very fast. I recommend the original one that has the beef in it. I personally don't like too much beef so I ask for only a little. Make sure to add some salt, pepper and green onions!"
1160053,"Went up by the pizza carrousel by the bar and asked the bartender for a slice. I was unsure of the price and I knew it was around $3 so I had $4 in my hands in case it was a little higher. When I asked the bartender how much my pizza would be he said $3 so I took the extra dollar out of my hand and handed him $3. He then proceeded to stand staring at me with his hand out. I then realized that he was obviously waiting for a tip...on a $3 piece of pizza. So I handed him two quarters(more than a 15% tip) and he replied with a sneer ""I don't take change "" and waited for me to tip him more. So I swiped my pizza away and walked out the door vowing never to go back. I mean first of all when was it ok to ask for a tip and why would anyone tip someone a dollar for $3 pizza when all the bartender did was stick it on a paper plate. Worst service ever! If you want pizza don't get it here instead head over to Pizza Ragazzi."
2147233,"And now they have a booth at the U-District Farmers Market on Saturdays!!! This stuff has got to be the most fattening yogurt in the world because it is too damn good to be good for you. I have no idea, I am just saying. The lemon curd yogurt tastes like lemon cream pie. If you ask them, they have honey yogurt in the cooler. I don't think I have ever seen it in the case. There is no better yogurt on the face of the earth and I have had them ALL! I am not kidding. I will be stopping by this place for a family size container every time I go to the market from now on."
814623,"The waterfront location in Redondo Beach is fairly nice, not breathtaking, and certainly did not make up for the not so great service and rather bland and mediocre meals our party of 5 had. 

The menu selection leaves plenty of room for improvement, too. The price vs quality of food / value definitely seems to be off here, in my opinion. If I evet was to go back and give it another try, I would definitely go for the take-out option and have a picnic on the beach nearby."
902655,"By far, the best pizza in town. It doesn't hurt that the view is insane either. Pegasus at Alki is a bit crowded (even after their expansion to the corner), but so worth the bumped elbows!"
1956168,"pros- great seafood. nice decor. great staff. good wine list. innovative menu.

cons- too loud."
1010966,"Overall good place. I can't understand the rave reviews for the chicken fried steak. Not that great in my opinion. The gravy was blah and the steak was from a premade frozen pack. 

That said, I thought everything else was good. Efficient service, hot coffee, good pancakes and waffles. 

I would go again."
61162,Been here twice.  So far the Royal Grinder is my favorite sandwich.  The bread is toasted to perfect crustiness.  The meats and delicious and the cheese melts just enough to stretch as you take a bite.  Tried the teriyaki sandwich but did not like as much as the grinder.
993638,"Went to Matt's today for lunch and had a great dining experience.  Was with a group of people and the restaurant was jammed packed!  We had one of the best servers ever...her name was Brittany.....if you are ever there ask for her section and leave her a good tip!  We received out appetizers, and entrees very quick.  I never had to ask for a refill on my beverage because Brittany was all over it.  One of the best servers I have had.....and believe me, I'm super picky!!  This is a great place for groups and happy hour.

Oh yeah...im not an oyster fan so i can't comment on the oysters. They have a lot of other variety to satisfy anyone's pallet.   Go for the Cheeseburger and Hot Chocolate for dessert!  I have had steaks here before which were really good for the money.  Had a prime rib dip today with the seafood chowder.  I could say both of those items need a bit of work to perfect.  Prime rib dip was a big overcooked and dry while the seafood chowder did not have much seafood in it...so this is why i give 4 stars today....some of the food needs some quality control."
2754484,"Excellent food service and environment
Thank you"
216084,"Love, love, LOVE!! I was introduced to this place by an ex-coworker who I had lunch with down at the market. I was so not impressed by the sandwich shop we ate at, but coming here afterward for dessert completely made up for it. 

They have plain, raspberry, and apricot croissants, which are delicious. I wasn't really a fan of the macaroons, but their amandine and chocolatine pastries are a must-try if you like sweets.

The chocolatine has a mix of sweet almond paste and chocolate in it, and the amandine is just the almond paste, so make your choice accordingly. 

I haven't tried the breads here because I'm just not into eating hunks of bread, but I've been assured from several other people that the bread is fresh and quite good.

Lastly, the normandie savory pastry they offer is an interesting type I've never seen elsewhere. It comes on a flaky pastry crust that looks like a square pie with the corners turned up. The middle is chicken in a creamy sauce. The only knock is that the sauce sometimes is a little too salty, so if you're watching your blood pressure like I am, this probably isn't a smart choice.

It's almost always busy in here, especially in the afternoons."
628824,"Great place to stop in for lunch or dinner.  Conveniently located right in Alderwood Mall.  Awesome food, friendly service, and great beer.  What more can you ask for?  I particularly like their bar area which has plenty of seating and large screen tvs for the sport fans.  Highly recommend."
835013,"Food is excellent, and ample servings. Staff went out of their way to learn my name, and shake my hand. Always checked on me. The Traditional Almond Roca is something that has to be tried. Kitchen will prepare just about anything you want, even if its not on the menu. 
 Try to eat outside when the patio is open, when the weather is good, it is an overall excellent atmosphere."
1458527,The Bartenders are great here and know how to make a Caipirhinia!!!
882222,"Visited last weekend for a quick dinner. The place seemed more like a take-out place even though there were quite a few people dining on site. I had a lamb gyro while my friend had a souvlaki meal. My gyro was good, but my friend thought the meal was not the best he's had. He tried some of my gyro and said he'd go with the gyro next time. Service was good and the place was clean. Would definitely come back."
1808504,"Yes!

Sometimes I sit and think about what makes for a 5 star review and today Nineveh made it really easy for me to explain. Basically when I think of a place that meets, or even exceeds my expectations, I'm ready to dole out the stars. In fact, when it's food-related, I typically have a ""I eat the food, not the service"" policy. As in, the actual food and the quality of the ingredients is more important than service. But when service is also awesome, it just makes the experience that much better.

I popped by Nineveh yesterday with a friend. Being from Seattle I was relying on his local expertise to guide me. Having never tried Assyrian food, I was totally up for something new. I parked right near the truck and as we approached the window to order, we were greeted by the friendly guy inside. He was helpful and offered suggestions regarding what to order, and he explained some of the dishes to make the ordering process easy. Actually, the descriptions of the food made ordering almost harder because everything sounded so great. I settled on a sandwich, which was more of a wrap, and my friend Nick had a salad. 

The portions were massive, the food was extremely tasty, and everything was reasonably priced and ready within minutes. Good service, good food... I don't know what more I could ask for! I don't think I could visit Olympia without hunting this truck down. Definitely some of the tastier food I've had in recent weeks. Thanks, Nineveh!"
893181,"Our new place for night time drinks, happy hour, and dinner spot. 
Wow, Lynnwood Soooooooo needed this place. It has a ""downtown Seattle"" night life vibe. Lovely dark, artsy atmosphere. But the FOOD..........DELICIOUS. There BBQ Burger is my FAVE. Awesome calamari. Yummy Sangria. Supper yummy Bread Pudding. We are now regulars. Go there multiple times a month. 
Staff is nice welcoming, and we really like a hostess named Jesse there. Love chatting and seeing her, she's funny and makes us feel welcomed! So glad I finally checked this place out."
1328244,"Visited Sunday evening for Restaurant Week. Huge RW menu with lots of seafood options and with many of their best dishes featured. Really liked that parking was free with our visit (park below restaurant and get your ticket validated), and that the hostess accommodated our hour early arrival. I was not totally sold by the atmosphere here... came across to me as kind of generic. The menu definitely made up for that. I got the thai hot and sour soup, the steelhead, and the coconut cream pie. Soup was amazing, highly recommend it! Steelhead seemed a bit dry, but the asparagus with it was very good. Coconut cream pie was possibly my favorite... all in all, this is a must for restaurant week!"
2159731,"Can I give this place ten stars?  The twice cooked almond croissant is one of the most delicious ANYTHING that I have ever tasted. The pizza is excellent too. I just tried one of their mint macaroons and it was so fresh and delicious, it tasted like fresh mint picked from a garden. I always take out of town visitors here and I advise all of you to do the same. One of the best bakeries in the country, I think."
777866,"Tried to go there on Saturday night. Initially we were told 3 hour wait, then 1 hour before closing they kept stringing us along until we finally did not get seated. I have eaten there before, and while I think the food is good, I don't think it warrants the hype. Customer service and time management is horrible however, I will never patronize them again, they need to eat some humble pie."
961570,"Took my daughter for lunch. We both had the clams and chips. In a word, terrible. Both orders came with about a 1/2 cup of fried clam pieces. Some pieces were just fried batter. The fries were soft and greasy. The best thing was the tartar sauce. Almost 25 bucks for two with sodas. Save your money, don't eat here."
870333,"Umi is a fun place to go if you're on a date - It's beautiful, the staff is friendly and they have great Sake. I don't think I'd go there for any other reason, however. The sushi is fine, but you can easily find better, and its a bit pricey."
173014,"I know this sounds weird, but the full size burgers taste better than the sampler! Really. They are very decently proportioned so good for sharing among our group. 

All the burgers are juicy and perfectly medium rare! Beautiful pillow of brioche bun. Remember to ask for the condiments you want, it's at the bottom of the menu ($0 to specialty $2). For the price of the burgers, I really think at all the sauces should be FREE and served on the side. Be warned that if you are one to douse your burger in condiments and additions, you won't be tasting the flavor of the burger meat... duh! You might as well go to McD's. And BTW, 'Gourmet Burgers' are more expensive, get over it!

- Lamb Burger $14 - love the garlic aioli and escarole (less bitter endive)
- Kobe Beef Burger $14 - juicy, flavorful, add some bacon.
- Boar Burger $16 - pass, juicy but not the best boar Ive ever consumed.

- Onion rings - crispy with a variety of sauces.
- Short Rib Poutine - yum, great flavor and tender rib, but wish it had more classic curds instead of the melted cheese. 
- Bacon Brussel Sprouts- yum
- Grilled artichoke - yum
- Grilled Pickles - pass. I bit into one poor pickle whose breading came off all in 1 bite. We were left with a bunch of naked pickles in the basket. 
- Garlic fries - please dont do it. 
- Truffle potato skin - pass. I'm a truffle snob and was disappointed. They use truffle oil that is extremely mild in flavor, a bit overcooked. 
- Bottle-glasses - love them. Great touch. Even better was the small jug of water at the table so we can pour our own, 
- Service - amazing. Greeted kindly at the door. The manager was cute and sweet, asking for our suggestions since the place was new..."
1678100,"One of my favorite thing to eat in Seattle- u have to eat the Cambodian noodle /shrimp, pork and fishcake......all of the other dishes are pretty below average. So only come here for this dish and NOTHING else. Oh yeah they have a hot sauce w/peanut in it that add deep and spice to your noodle. Yum"
1331143,"I was seriously addicted to their happy hour for awhile then had to cut myself off from it because although reasonably priced and amazing delicious (their sliders are drool worthy!) it was still getting expensive. Just came back after months away remembering that it was good but forgetting HOW good...ahhh so delicious! One of the best Happy Hours in the city! I feel like a a drug addict that's relapsed haha! If you haven't been here yet for Happy Hour, definitely try it out!!"
2163411,"Can not wait to go back!  Great service, absolutely delicious food!"
931952,"I always get excellent service and food here for a decent price. They describe themselves as "" authentic Thai food with an American twist"". I think that description really sums up what this place is all about. Great service and great food."
803087,"I wish I could say better about this place.  The food is actually very good, but the service is so horrible that I never want to come back again.  

First off, me and my party waited for almost twenty-five minutes minutes in a sort of awkward staging area, where although you write your name down on a list, the servers don't go in order and aren't around for you to ask questions.  I don't mind the wait (it was during lunch hour), but you can't find anyone to ask about how long it'll be, just a sign that tells you to write down your name and they'll get to you.  The workers who are around are taking food out the main door to the outdoor patio and can't be talked to.

Then, once we were seated, we waited another fifteen minutes to be acknowledged.  I don't mind waiting for service during the lunch rush, but when tables all around us (who were seated after us) are getting service and my table hasn't even gotten a quick 'It'll be just another few minutes folks', I get irritated quick.  

My spoon had some kind of caked on gunk on it (there's a picture posted of it on here) and when I told the server (when she came), she was barely apologetic and took forever to come back with a clean spoon.  I ordered an iced tea, which wasn't bad (home brewed) but my lemon slice already in the glass still had the sticker on it from the grocery store.  

Like I said earlier, the food was very good. I had the spinach salad, my mother had the open-faced turkey special, and my dad had a burger, and we all enjoyed our food.  Once we received the food, though, we only saw our waitress once more when she brought us the check, without asking us if we needed anything else.  The service was just atrocious, and it wasn't the first time I'd had a meal like this there.  I keep coming back because I like the food, but I'm reminded why I don't come more often.  I expect it to be different on subsequent visits but it never is.  I think that was our last visit."
189214,"Good food!
Fast and friendly!
Wont knock your socks off like i remembered after visiting other Vietnamese restaurants
Parking a little confusing 
Drinks came after our meal..a big no no which cost them a star
It was so so, its where the who whos of Seattle Asian DIstrict go for lunch!"
981180,"Delicious and affordable, The pizza can be made exactly how I like it, margherita style with the roma tomatoes on top and cooked longer than normal, or as they call it  crispy."
851600,Some of the absolute best Indian food I have ever had. This place will make you think twice about going to cheap Indian restaurants again (kind of like how a good burger place makes you think twice about McDonalds). My favorite main dish is the the tandoori chicken tikka and my favorite naan is the keema naan. I highly recommend trying out this place.
511052,"So one if my favorite places is Matt's in the Market and the chef here is supposedly from Matt's so what can I say.  The food is amazing (sorry Matt's, I'm still loyal to you)"
130287,"Eh, it was a little bit of a disappointment considering all of the hype I have heard. I came here for happy hour once or twice and had dinner with a friend. The happy hour items ranged from blah to very exciting. I think the good stuff greatly outweighed the bad though. Also, for dinner, I had a steak dish that was really good but not perfect. The steak was a little rubbery which might be my fault. Usually I like my meat basically freshly slaughtered kind of raw with plenty of blood but I think the cut of steak made for a poor choice.

Drinks were solid, not too strong but not whimpy either. Overall, I think I have had nothing but good experiences but again, I feel it is a little hyped. I hope to try more stuff on the menu and be surprised but I will hold my breath until then."
674526,"They make a very tasty burger here. The burgers are highly customizable. They come in many different varieties and various patties. You can get them in a meal or a la carte, you can even pick your protein. You can get them in 4 different sizes and what's even more dangerous is that you can get your burger with TOTS! Who doesn't like that? They're delicious. 

I am partial to the Kailua Style Burger or just the the Original Burger is really good too. I like how nice and beefy the burger tastes. Next time I go I wanna try the Spud Burger that has hash browns in it! I LOVE hash browns!

This place is very family/kid friendly, lots of bright colors. The fish tank is cute. Service is nice, efficient and friendly. I used to work across the street from Teddy's and it was very dangerous for my waistline! I don't go here as often as I used to but I  will definitely be back."
879178,"I have only been for Happy Hour and late night drinks, never an actual dinner but I have always been very satisfied. When we visit for HH we have the same bartender serve us every time, he is always relaxed and kind and never forgets our order. I enjoy the all day HH deals Sun- Tues and I really love the menu and drinks. Definitely recommend this place to my friends! Oh and it doesn't hurt that Satellite my fav coffee place is in the lobby!"
1730767,"I really enjoyed this place. The food was excellent and reasonably priced considering the class of restaurant. 

My friends loved their oysters and salmon. I had a great rib eye steak and really enjoyed  everything that came on the side. 

Totally recommend it."
2150425,"I had the best and worst here. Best mulita hands down. Worst tamale hands down. Despite the deliciousness of the mulita I will NEVER EVER EVER eat here again, my sister and I both got food poisoning from this food truck. YUCK!"
791325,"We went here for breakfast Saturday and after reading the reviews on Yelp I was really excited to try everything. The place is adorable, the line moves quickly and their cases are always being restocked with fresh baked goods. What's not to like about that? Unfortunately, aside from the most delicious gougere ever the quiche, croissant, and cannele did not measure up to what I expected. The quiche filling was perfect but the crust was a little burnt. The croissant wasn't soft at all or flavorful but the worst was the cannele. I've been to France, eaten my fair share of these delicacies and I make them at home. These were overcooked and the orange flavoring really took away from the crisp vanilla bean. I do not recommend ordering these. 

I do recommend ordering and consuming the gougeres at a feverish pace. They were absolute perfection and if I didn't live so far away I might consider going there right now for one (or two). 

For those not in the know, there is an adorable little patio in the back of the shop by the bathrooms for dining in. I highly recommend it."
816326,"THIS is our new spot!  Yum.  

Came in for our first time on Thursday evening.  My bf and I had some drinks at the bar and made a take-out order.  Not a lot of people dining in that evening, but saw delivery orders come and go.  Great, friendly service by every single staff member in the joint.  Nice atmosphere.  Gong and cartoons playing on the wall!  We walked back to our car with hot food and a good feeling when we left Lucky 8's. 

We got home, dug into our food and........AMAZING!  Not greasy just as others review, but packed full of flavor un-like what other reviewers mention.  SO so So so good.  We were missing an order of soup that we had paid for, but the food was so good and staff was so nice that we didn't even care.  Although a lil disappointed because the soup was probably amazing like everything else we had.  We know they didn't mean to leave it out.  It happens and we will for sure be back soon to taste everything at Lucky 8's!"
1104719,"This is the best little Thai place near the University. I've never sat inside because it's so tiny - I usually call ahead and pick up my food to go. Food is delicious, portions are good, price is good. I've heard rumors they had health violations in the past. No idea if it's true, but it doesn't stop me from going!"
804407,Amazing fresh crab. The only thing wrong with the meal was that I ate too much. 3 hours later and I am still stuffed.
895954,"Got a classic burger with hand cut fries and a peanut butter shake.  It was so good! A classic burger joint that also has unique variations such as Chicken Masala sandwiches.  Whaaat?!?!  So unique, I need to come back to try them all.  

The peanut butter shake had small chunks of ice, but was thick and smooth overall.  It's not too thick that I need a spoon to drink, but not watery.  The fries were surprisingly crispy on the edges, but still thick.  

Definitely returning."
1684786,Came here on a monday night and the perfect amount of people were there. Open til 2am and got a nice booth. Ambience is loungy . Loved the drinks and they are stiff. Left hand and odd mcintosh are recommended. The o henry is good too. All meat pie is a tasty pizza. But I loved the cheese platter to start. Alligator gumbo is unique but there are too many items to try so I wouldnt repeat that dish just because I want to see what else is delicious.
943008,"QB is the place to be for burritos. Seriously. My favorite burrito joint in town. If you're looking for 'authentic Mexican food' go to another restaurant because QB has their own excellent taste. Oh, and they offer cupcakes too now. How cool is that? 

The atmosphere of the interior itself has a very Olympia kind of vibe: they feature different art collections and change it up every so often, and the booths are plush and comfortable. Lighting is average and they play different music every time I come in. Its very lax and comfortable. 

The food is excellent and way filling. I usually go home with a box of leftovers. My personal favorites are the Joes Ranchero (deep fried of course) and the chicken tacos. I also always get the chips, salsa, and guac they serve. Occasionally a few of the chips come out underfried, but otherwise they're usually hot and delicious (and ready for me to devour.) Drinks are a little overpriced for what they are (3 bucks for a mexican coke glass, really?) so sticking with water is usually the best choice. 

Service is simple and straightforward. I've always been greeted properly, they've brought orders out in a timely matter, and they never are overly bothersome like other restaurants are when seeing how you are doing. I've never had an issue with any of the servers and they've never come across as rude or uncaring. Last time I went we had a great server with a pixie cut who was really friendly and made sure we had what we needed for our meal. 

If you have a big appetite and diverse palette, you'll definitely enjoy it here."
986569,"I can't believe I have never written a review for this restaurant .. even when I come here so regularly and introduce this place to many of our friends :D 

Short and simple .. most of their dishes are great .... order anything and you would be pleased .. their service is different than most restaurants  because it's half self-service .. so if you want water, you get it yourself and sometimes you order at the counter too .. but at least they will clean the table for you 

and for dessert, try the tofu pudding with red bean .. they are the best treat .. it's great for your body and in the summer heat, this will cool you down"
1896588,I've tried both the smoked club and the steak salad and both were amazing. Definitely recommend this place!
199753,"Boundary Bay Brewery & Bistro is another must try in the north sound for any beer lover. The tab room and bistro has a very rustic feel walls are adorned with great local artists' works as well as other eclectic items to create the cozy feeling in a large room. The staff is very knowledgeable of the beer and food and can always make good recommendations.  Again they offer a wide range of regular style beers as well as great seasonals and other new offerings. 

The food is really good as well to go with great beer. I ordered the Pesto Salmon Sandwich served on foccacia with a basil pesto cream cheese, lettuce, tomato and a house salad. The foccacia was perfect to hold the salmon and the basil pesto cream cheese gave the sandwich a different twist and match perfect with the fish. Try the alehouse vinaigrette nice on any salad. Nice place."
884843,Busy but fast service --- prompt coffee refills which always impresses me.
190653,"Wow, such a disappointment this time around. My husband and I came here for lunch on a Monday and had bad service. You'd think that if we were the servers ONLY table she might want to get a good tip but I guess not. My burger was actually really good but the long black hair in my salad was less than appetizing."
1658628,"Horrible experience!  You'd think that when there is a conference across the street, restaurants in the area would staff accordingly.  Meal took almost 2 hours to arrive after ordered - completely unnaceptable!!"
871668,"Went here for the first time and the food was really good. Got sesame chicken and it was a large portion of food with fried rice (that I didn't need to pay extra to have fried...grrr....I hate when places do that). It also comes with soup and that was yummy too. It was on the lunch menu and was only $8.71 with tax--can't beat that. They had a variety of things on their menu....a very strange variety. There were a lot of chinese dished I had never heard of and didn't sound the least bit appetizing, and I'm not a picky eater. 

The problem here is the service. When I walked in it was packed--all 30+ tables were full and many had large parties. Yet, there were only three servers--they were so slow and very rude, which I'm guessing I would be too if I had that many tables at once. Maybe they were short handed, maybe not. Regardless, they were slow to seat people, take orders, and greet you. I finally went up to the counter and paid because I was tired of waiting.

The food was good though. Worth trying out in hopes you don't get crummy service."
929653,"I have been here several times with my husband. Every dinner we've eaten has been a memorable experience.

We always get a multi-course meal: usually start with an appetizer, then get a soup or salad course, then two small pasta plates to share, the main entrÃ©e, and sometimes a dessert. The complimentary bread plate has a fantastic focaccia and delicious parmesan crisps. We have to exercise our will power not to get more than one plate so that we don't spoil the rest of our dinner!

I can only think of one time we didn't clean our plates, and it was the cauliflower side dish that's usually on the menu. It was a bit too spicy for me, and we were already past full from the rest of our meal. The chef seemed concerned that they cleared the cauliflower dish mostly untouched, and someone came out to ask for our feedback. We assured her that it was just not to our taste, and that the rest of our meal had been lovely.

If she's serving an heirloom tomato salad, be sure to get it, and ask for the burrata too. :3"
1746287,Best food love the deep fried mushrooms and the burgers wraps and french fries are so delish.  And the owner Agnes is awesome very family friendly environment
953892,"Wow stopped by Shari's for a quick bite, but that didn't happen. Our waitress forgot to bring us our sodas we ordered. The food took a long time to come. I ordered the surf and turf for dinner. When my food did come, my mashed potatoes were cool, as if it was sitting out for a few mintues. But unfortunately it wasn't a good dining experience for us."
893394,"Beautiful place, feels a bit crammed with the table arrangement, professional staff with above average service.
oh, btw, the serving size is American large"
2589979,"Really good food, personable and friendly servers, good prices. Really good tea. 

Winners!"
774380,"Went here before going to AMC on a Sunday night. The 3 of us ordered chicken satay and beef lettuce wrap for starters and Pad Thai with beef for main course. The chicken satay was OK, but the lettuce was bordering on limp and the ground beef was so salty that we sent it back. A couple at a nearby table heard us tell the waitress and told her their lettuce wrap was too salty as well so it wasn't just us. The waitress took the plate to the kitchen staff, but they just seemed to shake their heads. Not sure what their reaction meant as the waitress offered no explanation or apology. However, it was duly comp'd. 

The beef in the Pad Thai tasted odd, as if it had been lying around for a couple of days too long. Not really convinced they use fresh ingredients based on what we had. 

At the end of the meal, I just wished we'd just gone to for the burger place next door :-("
1100347,My wife and I dined here on December 31 and I really wanted to like Nel Thorn but the meal was a disappointment. Wait staff was awesome though. Seared tuna was not seared and very bland. Very nice little restaurant. Every square inch was put to use.
923403,"Yeah, it's loud. But the food is terrific -- absolutely gotta have the mac n' cheese -- and there is a sound wine selection. Plus, you can taste before you buy a glass. I'll go back."
1642396,"In a word this joint is Unremarkable.  Less than average food and average service. Right from the gate our waitress brought us a pitcher of beer with two piping hot glasses to drink from.  She made no attempt to replace them when made aware of the situation.  She shrugged and indicated there wasn't a cold glass in the house.  Really?  

The atmosphere has a good vibe albeit a 20 something hangout.   With so many better options within walking distance I can't think of a single reason to return."
1738581,"I come here regularly as it's close to my chiropractor and I either have extra time before my appointment or I make extra time. 

I've only ever had their tacos (they have lengua) and they're excellent. 

Staff is hard working and friendly. Prices are dirt cheap."
1100470,"I don't like Skillet.  To me, Skillet is like a booger that just needs to be picked.  Now that I've picked this annoying, large booger, I have no need to do it again because I realize how overrated it is.  No amount of drugs will ever be able to convince me that this place is not a total rip-off and an insult to diner food.  The third most popular photo of this place is of their $0.50 piece pork belly with one ugly egg thrown on a limpy waffle looking all sad and lifeless and shit.  I voted that photo with ""Very Helpful"" in that it portrays all of the characteristics of what I consider food appropriate for slaves: devoid of flavor, taste, any substantial nutritional value, and not giving a rat's ass about presentation.  Just empty calories that fill you up for an exorbitant price of $13.00.  Hmm. . .how about not.

The two things I liked about being here were 1.) my brunch date, and 2.) our hostess who kept the lines moving and asked us, in all seriousness, if we wanted to sit outside under heat lamps on a day that already felt like 68-70 degrees outside.  I hate trick questions.  However, I admired her enthusiasm and free spirit.  We declined her offer and she accommodated us and let us sit at the bar.  Once we sat down at the bar, the server presented us with lots of jars and lukewarm tap water.  Is this the part where we start jumping for joy about the lack of ice?  I don't know how much I care for the jars they put juice in because it reminds me of urinal cups.  I also don't care much for the bar area; the people we sat around smelled like a dog had died in between their legs.

I played it safe and ordered the curried chicken salad sandwich because I knew if I ordered cornmeal waffle of any sort, I'd have been pissed off for the entire day.  No one looked happy eating that god damned thing.  People who ordered and ate their waffle or pancakes had this look like it was a sense of obligation to eat it because it's Seattle and it's Skillet. The curried chicken tasted decent at its best.  The raisins gave the chicken a hint of sweetness, hazelnuts the crunch, and tomato because it's a tomato.  My gripe with the sandwich is that the cooks over-buttered the rye bread and left my fingers slicked with oil after picking it up.  I could have powered a lawn mower with that toast.  Their side salad did no favors for the sandwich, it was an ordinary salad. 

Their chilaquiles was definitely not worth the price tag of $14.00.  When asked for easy-over eggs, it ended up being overcooked.  The dish had absolutely no color and looked about as sad as the photo I mentioned above.  The dish was not inedible in any way, like my sandwich, but I expect a lot more for the price tag.  I expect more creativity and generally better execution.  If I am to wait in line for this, the food and service had better exceed expectations.  Unfortunately, Skillet has nothing to offer in getting anything on the mark in terms of the ratings and hype.  I'll pass."
1726626,"I've come here for dinner and lunch buffet. The buffet wasn't particularly exciting, but dinner gives an opportunity for them to showcase more exciting cooking. 

My favorite part of the buffet was raw veggies and bean dip - not your avg bean dip at all! Instead if being heavy and beany, it was creamy and cool and slightly sweet. Gobbled up all my veggies with it. The sweet black rice pudding was a little too sweet but that is easily remedied with a generous helping of coconut milk. Nothing else as particularly memorable but I'd happily come back for a satisfying and healthy meal for a very reasonable price.

Dinner was fun. Got a the drunken mushroom noodle dish and banana massaman curry. The drunken mushrooms seemed more like a mushroom stir-fry, but they tasted pretty sober to me. 

The banana curry was by far my favorite and worth coming back for on its own.  The banana becomes little pillows of sweet banana surprise in the curry. It just complements the spices in the dish so well. And it comes with roti to dip. And the roti is excellent.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other entrees."
2127593,"Fourth visit last night with friends, yet another excellent experience. Staff and service excellent, food superb especially all the pasta dishes and the deserts, excellent wine recommended by the staff (we don't know Italian wines). Tajarin is as billed by the staff a very special dish, but we found all the other pastas equally good, even the dishes that included usually ""gamey"" tasting ingredients like quail and rabbit were succulent and avoided this fate. Everything top notch highly recommended. The only possible negative is that the costs add up and before you know it with a decent bottle of wine you can easily spend $150/person all in. That being said, this is my current favorite restaurant in Seattle."
873695,Wanted to use a groupon here. The wait was an hour long for two people. Will try coming back in a slower day.

                                                                                    -Jon Rowley, Seattle's Oyster Guru

Every visit to Seattle should include at least one trip to a raw oyster bar, and with so many options to choose from, Elliott's stands up to the challenge in true fashion.

We decided to check this place out on a Saturday early evening without any reservations; we only intended on stopping by briefly just to try their oysters before heading elsewhere for dinner.

Located in the middle of a tourist trap near Pike's Place, the area was very crowded and fortunately we had taken a cab and didn't have to deal with what would've seemed to be a parking nightmare.

The views from the restaurant are beautiful, especially during sunset if you're lucky to be there on a nice day.  Immediately after walking in, we decided to grab a spot directly in front of the raw bar with a view of all of the different selections; the varieties seemed limitless!

On a time crunch, we decided to get two dozen with a sample of almost everything they had from all over the place:

     - Hama hama
     - Penn cove selects
     - Kumomoto's (personal favorite)
     - Henderson inlet
     - Totten virginica
     - Olympia
     - Calm cove
     - Little snookum (haha)
     - Shigoku
     - Mystery bay

As expected, everything was absolutely dellicious and very fresh.  Again, the Kumomoto's never fail me as I always prefer the type of oysters that are smaller in size and not as grainy or chewy as most."
1733954,"Love the Pick-Quick burgers!  I've been to the Auburn store a couple times, and it was great every time.   I usually get the double deluxe and fries.   It's not fast food, it's good food.  It's not slow, but it's not like the  corporate fast food garbage factories, it takes a reasonable amount of time just so that you know that your meal was made for you and not pre-cooked!
  It's not cheap, you won't find any dollar meal garbage, but it's priced reasonably for a good burger, around $7.50 for a double deluxe and fries, around $10 if you add in a shake.
  They're a small locally owned restaurant with only two locations, and their in store advertising supports locally sourced and sustainable.

Probably in the top five best burgers I've ever had."
870150,"New owners, mixed up ambience - rice cookers outside on the patio confuse me.  Menu now has some Asian dishes and again feels a little mixed up.  Not the place it used to be -- crossing fingers it will get better.  I don't recommend any longer."
1919356,Food decent- too much honey for the honey crepe. Apple crepe just not tasty-gave up and put jam on it. The cheese crepe had to be sent back to get the cheese melted.  Service was fast/nice but it was a flag down and repeat occasion after that. Just too many places like this and more minors than majors to recommend it or score it higher. I can make the same thing at home.
1896722,"We tried to go to Barrio next door, but after the lady told us it would be a 30+ minute wait, we headed to this place which had ample seating.

I had their tonic water, which was made in-house. I thought it was alright, perhaps a little strong, but the waitress who served it said many customers didn't like the taste. My friend got this yellow drink that came in the tiniest glass, and it tasted like rubbing alcohol flavored with ass. I had a sip and chased it with an entire glass of water. I wish I could tell you what it was called, but I don't plan on ever going back to ask.

We didn't order any food, but we spied plates being delivered to tables around us. For the price, the portions seemed small.

Service was nice, but that's not enough. Hit up a cheaper place with better drinks and less pretension."
1701254,"I was the first of my party to arrive. One by one, each of the 3 waitresses asked if I needed anything while I waited. So they were pretty attentive except that it took forever to get our bill. The restaurant was less than half full but it was so loud in there.

Their menu has the basics and some specialty items. We ordered the red curry with scallops and the Thai Ginger Special with beef. Both were very good. And they had no problem giving us separate bills."
1328171,"Seven of us had dinner there, so we ordered five dishes and a soup. Certainly it is very popular place and crowded with customers, which is always a very good sign. My friends are local. They told me that the restaurant only takes reservation for a party of six and up. Without reservation, it usually is a long wait. The food is very delicious. We ordered the seafood tofu soup , chicken with basil leave , the stir fry ,, soybean coated code fish , and the eggplant are all very yummy. Certainly will visit here again if I visit Seattle."
1717538,"Don't forget about their lunches!

I've eaten lunch here a couple dozen times and love the service and the food.  Their sandwiches always use high quality ingredients and the soups are divine.  Not to mention the reasonable prices...

My only complaint?  Sometimes they don't have enough tables!!"
1108950,"Very great server we had in the bar area!  He was really friendly and provided great service.  We weren't dressed up for such a fancy place, so it was really refreshing to feel like he gave us the great service he would give someone wearing a suit.

Stopped in for wine and some beer with some friends, the place was so nice inside.  Had a guy playing the piano, very nice lighting, it's right over the water, this place would be a great date spot.  Prices were very reasonable, would def come back here.  

Come in here just before sunset, get a view of the sunset while sipping on some wine or suds.  You can thank me later...."
922795,"Overall: ok food, but really oily!

I really really wanted to love this place. Their webpage said that ""all dishes can be prepared to suit special diets or vegetarians"". To me, that reads as dishes could be gluten-free, if requested, like some other Thai restaurants. This is what brought us into the restaurant. 

We arrived at 8:30 PM, and were still seated for dinner, even though their closing time was 9 PM (+1 star). At the start of the menu, it says that their food contains gluten and wheat (-1 star), but had one page of dishes that were gluten-free (+1 star). Unfortunately, the gluten-free menu was somewhat limited, and as far as I can remember, did not have any appetizers or curries (-1 star). 

I settled with the seafood fried rice, $14. It had a lot of flavor, but was lacking salt (a weird thing for me to say, because restaurant food is usually way too salty for me). It had about 3 prawns, 2 huge mussels, 1 scallop and squid rings. The dish was a good size to share, but I ate the whole thing myself. The bad thing about this dish was that it was really oily/greasy, which made it REALLY heavy (-1 star). I was constipated for the next 3 days (-1 star)!

A. ordered two appetizers: fried rolls and chicken skewers. His main was phad thai. He didn't even finish half of the dishes he ordered. Again, the food was tasty, but oily/greasy. His phad thai was glistening with oil, just like my fried rice. He also suffered for the next few days, and refused to eat the leftovers in favor of something a lot lighter. 

A good note is that you do get a decent amount of food for the price you pay, since most dishes come with rice. Staff: friendly and non-intrusive. Ambiance: ok. Bad note: too greasy. 

Tip: If you're going keep an eye out for the 15% off dinner coupon through the mail. Our total dinner cost ~$35 (excl. tips)."
1146004,"Our first time in Seattle and our first Tom Douglas restaurant. 

Small, quaint little place with basically 6 high top tables that fit 6 people each and a few 2 tops. We had seven and were able to fit. I imagine you may have to share your space if you have a large party. We were there on a Friday night at 7:30 and only had to wait 25 min. 

Kale salad was good but real lemony, once you got past the first bit, it was yummy. Basic motz, sauce and basil was our favorite pizza, then sausage. The mushroom and fancy cheese was excellent for the first piece but it was too rich to eat the whole thing alone. We also ordered the clam, and I would say the same thing about that. 

Waitress recommended their triple creme coconut pie for dessert, which she said they were known for but not on the menu. It was my favorite part of the meal, generous portion, yum!

Small, quaint, pricy, but a fun splurge."
1340357,"We decided to give Ping's a try with the family.  The kids love their dumplings.  We got an onion pancake, potstickers, dumplings, beef noodle soup, and xlb.  Polished everything off and then ordered Round 2 of dumplings and xlb.  What can I say...  my kids can pack it away!    Onion pancake was good - crispy and thin.  (My son ate it without complaining about the green onion!)  Dumplings and xlb were good too as we had to order another round.  Beef noodle soup was maybe a little bit on the bland side but my little girl had no complaints slurping up her noodles.  The only thing we were so excited for was the potstickers.  Not sure how they're made but they came out all connected and we basically broke them apart to eat.  My son ate one and passed on the rest.  They were crispy on the bottom but I'll admit I've never seen potstickers come out in one big round shape.  The lady and man that work there were super nice.  We were able to muddle through with a combination of Cantonese/English/and finger pointing.  We'll be back!"
667734,"I'll make this quick and easy and echo the sentiments that this place is quick and cheap. 

I took the train from Westlake to here to try what my co-worker touted as ""the best Thai food in Seattle.""  

We got there just before the lunch rush and got a table.  I ordered the Panang Beef, spicy, of course, and the fresh spring rolls.  After maybe a minute, I got my entree.  There were 3 of us and our meals came out one at a time.

I was so hungry that I didn't realize that my meal was curry-based, which I am not a fan of, however, it was a little on the peanut-y sweet and I rather enjoyed it.  It could have been a little more spicy, but all in all, it was great.

We got the vegetable spring rolls which tasted pretty fresh and had a good peanut sauce to go with it.

I'd come here again and I'd probably go to the one one Pike since it's closer to my work, but I am excited to try my yooshe, which is Tom Yum Goong.

I left here happy I got my hole-in-the-wall Thai fix.

(Ok, so it wasn't quick.)"
803937,"Surprise, it's fresh! Delish bento, chirashi, and spicy tuna nigiri.  Fast, friendly service and sashimi at the right cut and temperature. What a gift to Georgetown!"
854569,"Great spot for brunch.  A little on the pricey side, but well worth every penny.  Don't miss the fresh strawberry jam, lemon scones, smashed garlic potatoes and thick cut bacon.  Yummy!"
981826,"I just saw that Grace closed, and was sorry they could't make a go of it. I can see why, but I thought the place had a bit of charm. 

The mall really does need that middle ground meal restaurant, - reasonable, local Americana. The other good thing about this place was that they served Stumptown coffee.  

I don't know what the heck was going on there in terms of management and execution of what could have been some great meals, but someone was definitely NOT running that show. Hopefully the next casual concept TD restaurant (Ala Bravehorse, which is fabulous!) does a little better."
1694730,"First time in this place. Clams and muscles are great and the lemonade taste home made. Great location and friendly people. Loved our server Theresa. The only not so great thing about this place is the parking,"
966298,The food is excellent.  The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is fun. The only negative about this place is the prices are a little high but not so bad that I wont come back whenever I'm in the area. (Luckily for me and Five Guys there isn't one by Northgate.)
1703151,This place has unbelievable ribs and their BBQ Bulgogi is the best!  My girlfriend also mentioned that their Tofu Soup was the best she'd ever had.  I recommend this place.
1721675,"My husband LOVES all meat chili so when I saw this on the food network and that they give you the option of beans or no beans...this was a definite place I wanted to take him for his birthday.  He loved it and it is a nice hole in the wall place to watch the game, have some chili, and a few drinks.  If I lived closer, I would be there every week!"
1717541,"Unassuming strip mall cafe...I think yet just threw in tables and a counter to configure it to open.  :). Super friendly staff greeted me instantly and gave me a sample of the hollandaise in request.  The hollandaise is thinner than typical but has a very nice flavor that stays on your palette.  It does have a more pronounced lemon flavor than you'll find on the east coast but there's something unique about it that draws you in.  

I ordered the eggs Benedict with your choice of ham, turkey, or bacon with onions and peppers as well as your choice of potatoes.  
The ham looked and tasted like the deli sliced package ham you'd buy with your sandwiches...not a good decision on their part.  The egg was perfectly poached and the the English muffin was adequate.  The hash browns were so amazing that they wet stealing the thunder from the hollandaise sauce.  They were the first hash browns I've seen that were shredded so finely and fluffy yet crispy on the outside.  They peel and shred the potatoes themselves and I love that kind of attention to detail.  

The cook came out since it was slow and she was a very elated lady.  She gave us complimentary  homemade cookies because it's that kind of down home neighborhood cafe.  Good people, great food, fantastic stop!"
793923,"I've been recommending this place to people for years now but no more. We went on a Friday night when it wasn't terribly busy. We ordered two drinks, two entrees, rice and spring rolls. Our entrees came out quickly but we never recieved our spring rolls. When the bill came we asked for the spring roll charge to be removed and I gave him my card to run. Never in my wildest dreams did I think they'd try to pull something. The server ran my card but instead of removing the $5.95 charge for the springs rolls he only took $2 off the bill. Did you really think we wouldn't notice that you were ripping us off? The problem was pretty easy to fix, we just took the amount the server was stealing from us out of the tip. It was just a really awful thing for them to do. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone ever again and with the hundreds of Thai restaurants in Seattle I'll be finding another that won't steal from me."
1104739,"Food is good, but the atmosphere is normally very stressful. With the limited seating area, you are almost always taking food to go, and the servers are not that polite either. Obviously, they have great business due to the good inexpensive food, and it is working for them. Next time, I would call ahead to place my order and make it a to-go."
1891771,The food was excellent. The service sucked.  You choose.
455804,Should hip and Louisiana go together. Well they do at this place. I love the vibe at this place. Really cool playing. The place is candle lit at night. And even though I have been here ten times I have yet to find anything on the menu that I don't like. The menu is gigantic so be prepared to spend a while with it if its your first time. If for some reason you don't like spicy food make sure to tell the server so they can steer you clear of the hot menu items
675233,"Best thai in West Seattle... some of the best Thai in Seattle.   Trendy, but comfortable and not too pricey!"
1915147,"Last October when I visited Seattle for the first time, I ate here for breakfast or brunch 6 times in 5 days. I had something different every time, and a different mimosa every time, and not a single thing was less than amazing. The hash, the gluten-free French toast (which I thought was better than the regular), the scrambles... I could eat here forever :)"
1509538,"I was invited to a dinner with the chef and impressed. In the middle of a business park in Bothell, there is an old barn that has been made into a beautiful, comfortable but classy restaurant.

The food was excellent. The scallops were seared beautifully, crisp on the outside, but still creamy on the inside. The lamb was delicious (and this is coming from one who doesn't like lamb), and the duck was perfectly prepared.  The menu has a full range of choices, seafood, a huge variety of meat and poultry. You'd have to go several times to sample everything.

The dessert menu was just as extensive. The seasonal apple crisp was quite good (inspiring me to make some baked apples for dinner tonight) and the chocolate gateau was rich and molten. Just wonderful.

The service was attentive and unobtrusive. Wine glasses and water goblets were never empty.

Russell's is a great place for a business dinner or a special prom or anniversary night. I look forward to returning here."
794015,"I was starving after flying into town. We were going to head to another yelped review pizzeria, but my eyes were glazed and I was wasting away.  

We asked the hotel front desk what was in the area. Zeeks was walking distance. It was more like ""linner"" time on Mother's Day. Not too busy. We sat at the bar. Hubby let me order the pizza of my choice since we were in Seattle as a spontaneous birthday surprise. 

Our sausage, mushroom pizza was awesome. Hot, crispy, not too thin chewy crust that held up to the toppings and cheese (no soggy middle!) and good sauce. Washed it down with a root beer float. Would have gone back if I had a longer trip."
186656,"Went last Saturday around 1030 and boy was this place busy.  Even so, the wait was not to bad (20 minutes) and was able to find a place to sit while waiting.  It did take a little bit of time for someone to talk to us, however that gave us time to look over the menu and discuss what looked good on the menu.  Overall, the waitress was awesome and the food was highly enjoyable.  We ordered chicken fried steak with eggs along with homemade corned beef and hash.  We both came in very hungry and by the end of the meal we were full with leftovers to bring home.  

I will not be suprised if more of these pop up in the Seattle area."
1039951,Though I normally like  Chipotle this location seems to always have a crazy long line and something there made me sick. The only thing I'm allergic to is milk products but they assured me nothing I got was made with even butter. But 30 min later I'm sick. Either butter or bad food but I won't be going back to this location again
1334063,"We loved this place! Their rachel's #3 ginger beer was so delicious that I am curious to try the #1 and #2 if I ever find them. The blasted broccoli taste just as awesome as the name sounds. We also really liked the hanger steak. Some places overcook their hanger steaks and it may taste very tendon-y and hard to chew, but this place cooked it right and it was good paired with the daikon and sprouts/cucumber. The ambience was relaxed and mellow. The waitress was so graceful and courteous that she reminded me of a museum curator. Overall, I had a great time here."
816812,Pretty good seafood for cheap.  This is way way better than Long John's.  The staff is also very nice.
888448,"I came to A&O during my recent visit to Seattle, and was looking forward to their oyster ""power hour"" ($1 oysters from 5-6pm).  I was annoyed to learn that power hour was canceled for Restaurant Week, esp as I was not planning to participate in RW.  RW or not, diners are diners and I thought it was silly of A&O to cancel power hour.

That said, their oysters were fantastic even if pricey.  I had the Penn Coves, Barron Points and Sea Cows, which were incredible.  The oysters are prepared with the mignonette dressing, so, if you prefer them plain, like me, be sure to ask for the mignonette on the side.  I had to send back my first round of oysters as I only take my oysters with lemon.  Fortunately, my server was more than happy to ask the oyster guys to re-shuck a new batch of oysters for me.  Given the exceptional quality of the oysters, I would LOVE to come back and try the power hour if I'm ever in Seattle again.

For entree, I was torn between the bigoli and the linguine (with uni butter).  The bigoli won:  a whole wheat pasta with white anchovies, chillies, garlic, mint and bread crumbs.  The portion was large, hearty and delicious.  I am normally not a fan of whole wheat pasta, but this was surprisingly good.  The anchovies are ground into the pasta, along with the chillies and garlic, and the bread crumbs give the pasta a nice texture.  I loved the simplicity.  The pasta was flavorful, slightly on the saltier side (which for me is fine), and paired well with an Oregon pinot noir that really cut the intensity of the flavor for me.

No dessert as I was absolutely stuffed from my dozen oysters and Bigoli!!"
1163424,"4+. I'm a sucker for a Philly cheesesteak but they are not all created equal. Philly boys does a higher quality ingredients version of The Original Philly Cheesesteak across from Franklin High School on Rainier--but doesn't try to upscale it  too much like Tat's. Perfect. Smaller selection (no pepper cheese, darn it) but I'm good with doing a few things well. Hand cut fries are great, seasoned perfectly. Don't bother with the small size, you'll want more."
208541,"I've only been to Gilbert's once and my mind still lingers on the Turkey Havarti Crepe that I ordered on that warm summer day. My friends and I was on our way back from our camping trip were a bit famished, so we stopped here for lunch. This place is a quite small, so there is a limited amount of seats. It wasn't particularly busy, so we managed to find a big enough table for all of us while we wait for our food to arrive. 

After about ten minutes, our order was called out and I dug into my crepe. It was really good: loaded with gooey cheese, a few slices of deli meat, some spinach, and a white cream sauce, topped of with some cracked pepper. It was a nice light snack and when I finished it, I wished I could order another one. It was simple, comforting, and satisfying all at the same time. 

Albeit, a little pricey, Gilbert's offers fresh and simple food with a humble flair, hidden in the quiet streets of old Bellevue."
839106,"Ok, if you haven't been here in a bit maybe you should give it another try. After they remodeled at the end of the summer, 2012, the place has been way better. They started using a new product vendor for the food as well and it's been the biggest factor. The wings, which is what they've always been known for, are way better now. Honestly, just about everything I've tried has been way better and I've yet to find something on the new menu that I didn't like.

As for the ""rest of it"", it's Hooters. Know what you're walking into before you open the door. I don't understand people who go to Hooters and complain about the ""uniforms"" the girls wear. Did you not read the sign? Have you never heard of this place? It's what they're know for! I always have a good time and usually get a Hooters girl that is fun and entertaining. Get over your self conscious, pretentious attitude and have some fun!

I'm still going to stick to the fact that they really do have the best wings in town. And a boneless and/or no-breading option is nice for those who care about that sort of thing. This place remains on my regular stop list."
839681,I am from Turkey and the $50 breakfast was not good.  Nothing was made with love as all Turkish food should be prepared. The only highlight was the tea! Never again.
161867,"Want to know how I know this place is great?  About 4 hours after I left, I burped and it tasted of hickory smoke. 'Nuff said. 

If you want to keep reading, the most important two things at a bbq place are their meat and their sauce. The ribs had a medium level of hickory smokiness, and were fall-off-the-bone good. If you don't like smokiness you might not like this - a medium smoke isn't for the faint of heart. For me they were probably the best ribs I've had at a restaurant in Seattle. 

The sauce was excellent as well. It was sharply tangy with some sweetness. It should go without saying that the sauce was a level above the low grade corn syrup bbq sauces you get in the supermarket. 

The waffle fries were good - they're waffle fries, how can they not be good? 

The hush puppies with jalapenos and cheddar were disappointing. I tasted no jalapenos at all, and the cheddar made the insides mushy and have less hush puppy flavor than normal hush puppies. That's my only complaint, and it's minor relative to the meat and sauce."
1875665,"Yelp says their two-star review is for ""Meh. I've experienced better."" That's an understatement when it comes to Amber, but it wasn't quite bad enough to receive only one star.

I'm shocked at how mediocre the food here is. To start, my burger tasted like it was microwaved. I've never experienced a similar taste when I've eaten a burger. It wasn't good. I was hoping the fries could swoop in and rescue half of the meal, but they turned out to be bland. Very frustrating. 

I also got ribs, but they were drenched in a non-BBQ sauce that wasn't very good. 

Moving on from the food, the restaurant smells like cigarettes. It's not subtle, either. They need to have the place cleaned.

Two positives, and thus two stars. The beer was good and cheap ($3 drafts during Happy Hour), and our waitress was really nice and attentive. 

Overall, though, this place needs new ownership. To be at a prime location in Seattle and only have 2.5 stars overall is a disaster. At the very least, have Robert from ""Restaurant: Impossible"" come in and help out."
1001564,Seattle's street numbering system is a bit screwed up but with a call to Al we DID find him...and it was worth it!!!  VERY personable guy and GREAT food!!
1311948,"It was our first time there last night.  I had bookmarked it to try for happy hour, I guess that will have to wait.

So, first impressions: definitely upscale.  I like the booths that lined the hallway leading to the main dining room (where we dined, but I wished we had a booth).  As we were seated, our water was poured, the servers placed a napkin between us and the glass so no splashes would occur (I've never witnessed that before).  

Our waiter, Mark, was super professional answered all our questions and made great suggestions as we made our way through the menu.

Our meal:
Wilted Spinach Salad: It's huge, and made tableside.  It started with my Vitamin B (bacon), I stole that from the person making the salad.  Then mushrooms, red onions, the vinaigrette, and almonds.  That mixture was then tossed with the spinach in a bowl.  He plated the spinach while the quail eggs were frying up and added last.  It was completely delectable!  The yolk running onto the salad as it broke gave it a creamy texture!

42-day aged rib eye, garlic mashed potatoes, and chanterelles with shaved brussels sprouts: Let's be real, the rib-eye was the true star.  I'm a purist, so I didn't want any sauces competing with the flavor of the beef.  They provided 3 different salts to add to the beef.  And the beef had a perfect crust on it, it was marbled beautifully, it was beefy, nutty, and oh so damn good!  Seriously, one the best pieces of meat I have ever had. 

Dessert:  Sadly we had none.  We were too stuffed!

John Howie lived up to its reputation for being a great steakhouse.  

We will definitely be back, probably for happy hour, since fellow yelpers rave about it.  And we are looking forward to it."
1692075,The Vietnamese Sandwich was delicious!
694051,"My friend had been raving about Malay so I met her for lunch there today.  We got there around noon and we were the 4th table occupied but by 12:15 the place was pretty full.  We got lunch specials and they arrived before we could even finish the delicious celery-tofu broth that came with the meal.  I had the pineapple chicken and it was tasty.  It definitely had a little bite to it that kicked up a notch over time.  The menu had plenty of pictures and descriptions which I found quite helpful.  

The service was great when it came to the food but lacked in the after meal.  Our food arrived quickly and the plates were taken away shortly after we finished.  But we waited 10 minutes for the check.  I managed to flag someone down and we then got the check in less than a minute.  When the server returned my friend's card and the receipt for her to sign, she walked away with the pen.  I was able to find one in the depths of my purse but it was a little odd.  

I'll definitely go back to the Hut because the menu definitely teased me with future possibilities."
188747,"The bf's 2nd favorite burger joint (after RR, cuz they never disappoint). Not my 2nd fav, but probably top 5. I suggest their great happy hour, otherwise you may feel shafted. The Pike is fire! Can't go wrong with the house 8oz. Looooove the soft & salty garlic on the crisp fries - definitely one of the best I've had.. better than the M's games for sure. Everything was a tad salty for me.. the burger patty, fries, onion rings,etc.. but I'm not the salty gal. =) Wash it all down with a couple cold beers, which I was pleased to find that they have quite a few on tap. It's pretty pricey for a burger; not a ""best bang for your buck"" type of establishment, but the quality of their products exceeds its competitors."
815298,"Our food was out quickly, and the server was friendly enough. The atmosphere was friendly and family oriented. The price was reasonable, but the breakfast was unremarkable, save for the fact that it tasted like the individual ingredients. None of the flavors of either dish we ordered came together in a cohesive way."
1733393,"I'm not much in to fried chicken, but this place is great. The servers and cooks are warm and welcoming. The food is really good. The interior is a little div-y, but fits the business perfectly."
259039,"OMG I don't know what to say beside this food ..that BBQ chicken.. those coconut prawns.. that Tropical storm drink.. those habenero prawns x_x.. that rice.. those chicken wings.. that water.. those brews.. that service.. WAS SO DARN GOOD!

My Beau and I came for happy hour and we really didn't know how popular this place was and I still didn't know it was 224 reviews popular! Sheesh! I'm glad we checked this spot out. I hope ppl didn't get too annoyed having to wait for seating because nobody wants to leave! Even we kept ordering a number of small dishes. I kept inquiring about everything on the menu and the waiter s/o to CHUCK! I know he got tired of my questions, but he serviced us cool calm & collected. btw where is everyone parking?

See you yelpers around because we will be regulars."
808472,"Seeing as I frequent this place so often, it's worthy of my yelp review finally! I always have a great experience here. The staff is nothing short of friendly, and they always recognize you and ask you how you're doing. The food is wonderful. Of course their gyros, but their gyro plates and other items are great as well. It's a wonderful place to stop and grab something quickly to fill you up, and very reasonable prices for the U district. 

Best thing they ever did was make it non cash only! Thanks guys! I can save my laundry money from now on! ;] 

Oh and always order the Greek fries!!"
1729835,"I go here for Geek's Who Drink.  The food here is so expensive for pub food! It isn't that great- I've had the mac and cheese ($14???) and other items (onion rings $9.45) that basically taste like frozen rehash. Don't go here to eat; do drink, but it will be spendy."
549049,"I knew a guy in Chicago who ate the Potbelly Turkey Sandwich everyday for a year and when he went on vacation, they would be worried about him when he didn't show up. I laughed then, but now... Do you know how hard it is to get a good lunch for under $6 in bellevue or even under $8 dollars? It's hard. Its this or a slim jim from Jimmy Johns, and that doesnt taste good. Jimmy Johns youre on your own with packets of yellow mustard but at Potbelly's you get peppers and you can even get a huge pickle for $1 extra. I mocked the turkey guy, but now my budget calls him a savior. All Hail The Potbelly Turkey Sandwich. 

You can order online but the line goes so fast that it doesn't matter. Free wifi too."
1488128,"Saba serves up the perfect spicy veggie combo platter that compels you to keep dipping in, until that injera is all gone and has ballooned up in your belly. By then, it's too late. You're feeling a little uncomfortably bloated, but so happy! 

The food is delicious, the spices are bold, the amount of veggies and method of preparation is awesome. I've been a few times and have yet to try the chicken and lamb tibes. 

I will note that the last time I was there, my friends and I chatted quite a while after we'd paid the check and weren't bothered...yet I could have done with water refills, which we never got throughout the meal."
904643,"One of my all time favorites. Matt has gone to special lengths to make sure the quality of his ingredients are top notch. The search for the best pastrami. Don't worry...he did all the work. 
The chili sauce is awesome. I followed Matt's all over the place and make a special trip down there to get the best dogs and sandwiches around."
998681,"One of my top 3 pizza spots in Seattle.

Good crust- not too thick, not too crispy.  Quality ingredients. Combinations are well thought out. I rarely see a one too many items pizza offered.  You can add one, but at least the house knows what they are doing. My favorites are the margherita and the romana, but I am always in for the specials. They also have a nice wine selection. 
Service is friendly and attentive. The dining area is utilitarian but who cares- it's good pizza."
796124,Downgrading my review from last August. The service was slow and not as attentive.
1735370,the food is delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful to dine in. I like to eat in the train booth that they have in the middle of the room.  the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I have had no issues and I go back time after time.  great place to go!
1181338,"Panda logic to drive 2.5 hours for a ghost pepper burrito.

For a limited time (ending on the Day of the Dead), Mucho Burrito offers their ghost pepper burrito at all locations. Choose from ""Hotter than Hell"" or ""Wimpy."" Only difference is the sauce used (wimpy gets medium, Hotter than Hell gets ghost sauce).

One ""Hotter than Hell"" chicken burrito, please.

The burrito contains ghost pepper bacon and ghost pepper fig marmalade, plus whatever other fillings you want inside.

The marmalade gave this burrito a nice sweetness that offset the tangy ghost sauce. It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, but don't be fooled; there's still clear ghost pepper flavor and the heat is not for the timid.

Video of me devouring and reviewing the burrito for science. http://www.youtube.com/w¦

There's also a spicy chocolate bar available for $1.25. Again, a noticeable kick, but nothing nuclear hot. Quite pleasurable use of the peppers against the milk chocolate.

Definitely worth the drive to warm up my insides. I just wish there was a location closer to me and for the ghost pepper burrito to be offered all year."
1745703,"The place looks kind of run-down on the outside; the inside looks like a German restaurant from the 60's or 70's. The quality of food, really depends on what you order. German pancakes are good, but not great. Don't order the turkey dinner, unless you like almost-crunchy, rubbery turkey. Other breakfast items, like eggs and pancakes are good, but you can get the same thing at an IHOP. I'd make a lot more trips here, if the service wasn't so poor. Our waitress literally took almost 10 minutes to greet us, then another 10 to ask for our order, and even longer to get our check. The staff just isn't friendly; nothing more than order-takers."
1206795,"I feel like im such a hotpot/shabu snob.  but this place is weird.  Ive been searching for the best shabu/hot pot in and around Seattle... 
my friend and i came in for dinner last Saturday, we parked in the lot and was completely lost around the building (we walked pass the restaurant a couple times looking for it).  Once we walked in i wanted to walk right out, but it would've been awkward.  service was great, the waitress was telling us about how good their fresh hand pulled/shaven noodles were.  i told her we were there for the hot pot, she then explained how it worked... they can either cook it for you, or you can cook yourself.
i thought it was a little odd, you help yourself at the refrigerated area.  it was so confusing, there's a weight minimum of 1lb per person (which we didn't know until we were weighing our food).  normally i would think thats fine, but for some reason nothing looked appetizing.  maybe because they were running low on EVERYTHING, it looked like they were closing up soon because there was barely anything left and it looked like others have already picked through it.  they also offer some cooked appetizers, but is not by the pound (they charge set prices per size of plates).... its so weird, i kept going back and forth because i had no idea what was going on.  the miso flavor broth did not taste like miso (i guess that's my fault, its a Chinese restaurant... i shouldn't have ordered a Japanese broth).  the ""sauce area"" looked gross.  the area consisted of store bought quart size cans that were opened with a ladle for scooping.  presentation was awful.  sauces weren't special, nothing good.  i did think it was odd they offered ""msg"" in one of the containers.  anyway, i wont be back.  i was fooled once by the yelp pictures (probably when they first opened) but now i know better."
1689769,"i would give it a 3.5 but yelp dont let me so a 3 it is
4 for the variety of food, we went on a friday night and they jack up the price.

Awesome! the cooked food was meh, kinda reminded me of a panda express, lots of prime rib, grilled sausage..yeah dont think i came here to eat that.  They did have crab legs..whoopee not cracked, too much work for too little meat, same with the crawfish.  Lobster was cooked chinese style hmmm the preferred style, lots of claws, and gills, you need to dig for the tail part!

The sushi rolls was full of cucumber..huge pieces, the good thing about their nigiri rolls is there was very little rice.  Salmon sashimi was meh whatever, can't expect much from an AYCE japanese buffet place.  THere was scallops

Waiter was awesome, kept my coke full, yeah i know i filled up on coke but i love coke and sushi.

So 2 hours later I'm home and i have an urge to go to the washroom. YEAH! im guessing that came from dinner, oh wells, I have a 4 hour drive back to Vancouver the next day ughhh

My friend wanted to try it out and I was his wingman, would I come here again, maybe but would go on a monday-thursday night."
1326588,"Amazing, delicious, great quality, cheap. Huge pieces of sashimi, great chicken and beef teriyaki and sashimi set for $12. Love it! Very small so keep in mind if you want to eat in, you'll have to wait, otherwise, get it to go and walk over to a park."
688819,"Love this place. Can hurt the wallet if you eat regularly though! Spicy dumplings and every iteration of dumpling is delicious. Long wait times though! They have a text message system now so it's not so bad. Put name on list then go shop for a while while waiting for a text,"
1397487,"I really want to love this place, because the Lynnwood area is desperate for a great children's play center.  That said, there is room for improvement.

-I think the no outside food/drink rule is really silly, considering what you pay to get into the play area.  I just don't like it from a customer service perspective.  It seems kind of tacky.

-I have been twice, and both times we visited, there were incidents with ""accidents"" in the play area.  The first time (accident in the ball pit), I was assured it had never happened before.  The second time, there was a wet spot on the carpet that really should have been labeled or marked off.  Instead, I was told by another mother that there was a urine accident that was cleaned up but just left to dry without any indication to parents and kids to avoid it.

-Maybe it's just because of said urine incidents, but I just don't feel like the stuff is all that clean.  I compare it to a place like Gymboree, where they clean the equipment at the end of each day, and it doesn't really stack up.

-People don't watch their kids, and as the parent of a young toddler, it's very annoying.  Older kids especially, will grab toys, hit, yell, etc, with no parental monitoring whatsoever.  I wish the staff would encourage/require supervision.

-Limited hours.  M-Th they close at 4, which seems like an odd time.  Many toddlers are just waking up from their afternoon nap around 3, and school-aged children are only just out of school.  I would be much more inclined to buy a multi-visit pass if they had more logical business hours.

I will probably go back to this place when we are desperate for an indoor activity, but with a few improvements, I would be a very good customer.                     Show owner comment »"
670701,"I wasn't impressed by this place. The atmosphere is nothing special, they seem to always be closed (even during business hours), and the food was alright. I honestly don't know what else to say about this.."
855236,"Disgusting, yet I couldn't help but contribute to this wall of madness."
1055108,"I'm glad I went here - so that I know not to go again!! 
The place is dirty, the service is weird, and the food is sub par. 
They get two stars because the food did fill me up and it's not the WORST I've been to. 

I love burgers and I was really sad to experience such a bad burger here. Their menu right at the front is nicely written, clear, with some really yummy sounding items, which boosted my confidence before ordering. 

I ordered a California Burger with fries ($6.25 + $1.75). They gave me a little plastic chip with a number on it that they called when the order was ready. The guy taking my order did not speak English very well and he needed me to repeat myself three times before he got it right. When he asked if I wanted a drink and I said no, he acted incredulous and said ""no?!"" while reaching for a cup; a little weirded out by his disbelief, I cautiously repeated ""no"" and then he seemed to get it. 

The food came out fairly quickly but I was really disappointed. The buns were the very cheap kind you buy in bulk and go stale and flat quickly. The patty was tasteless and obviously prefrozen. The lettuce, tomato, avocado, bacon and cheese were fine. But it was the house sauce that was disgusting - too sweet, too thin and runny, very artificial tasting and plain gross. They put way too much on and it sunk into the bread, making it a mushy mess that fell apart as I ate it. The fries were, again, the standard cheap prefrozen kind that lack any distinctive flavor except for too much salt. The ketchup they had on the table was unusually runny - as I squirted some out, I thought they must have added water to this for it to be so runny! It was so thin it didn't even stick on the fries. 

My hands got really messy as the copious amount of pinkish-gray house sauce dripped all over them, and as I tried to hold together the disintegrating burger while various ingredients fell out. They don't give you napkins - there is an automatic dispenser on the wall near the soda fountain, like an automatic paper towel dispenser in a bathroom. That was weird and annoying. They have signs everywhere that say to bus your own table. 

In order to get the yuck off my hands, I got the bathroom key and went to the bathroom. Which was also gross, and dimly lit. Used paper towels littered the floor. Graffiti covered walls, toilet paper dispenser, paper towel dispenser, mirror, etc. How hard is it to just peel off the graffiti covered stickers? It seems this place is content being dirty and poor quality. 

Side note: If I was drunk, I'd probably be pretty happy with the place though."
791001,"I have never given a restaurant a one star review before. I actually wish I could give this place a zero. It's that awful.

In five words:

Disgusting food.
Slow service.
Overpriced.

In more:

By far the worst Mexican food I've had in as long as I can remember. Look at the other bad reviews and you'll see that this place is pretty much love it or hate it. 

I HATED it.

I ordered the steak and enchiladas in mole sauce, two things I've enjoyed dozens of times at other places. Here, it was a huge mistake. The carne asada steak was of average quality, but the mole sauce was absolutely putrid, and they completely drenched everything on my plate in it. 

I was there with a group for a birthday dinner and we had already been sitting there for more than an hour before we finally had food, so I wasn't willing to attempt sending it back, even though it was disgusting. I snacked on rice and beans from the plates of other people at my table..as the dish I had ordered was inedible.  

As many other people have complained, the service was incredibly slow...and my glass was empty nearly all night, which was a shame because I had nothing to wash the disgusting taste of their awful food out of my mouth with. Even though we asked prior to ordering, they refused to split the checks, which added to the wait time even after the meal was over.

If you're looking for good Mexican food in Seattle, I recommend Gorditos, Mama's or Peso's instead. I've actually never been to another Mexican restaurant that I wouldn't recommend you visit instead of this place. 

I will never go back.."
2164161,"Happy Hour at Barolo is at a level unmatched in Seattle!  Many items and have not had a dissapointment yet.  Rigatoni, Hanger Steak, Lamb burger & prochuitto (sp) are all awesome.  Service is friendly, fast and professional.  Their HH wine is always excellent for the price.  When I came for dinner recently the Osso Buco was devine!  I'm going to try the antipasta plate next time as I've eyed it a couple times on other tables and it looks absolutely scrumptous.  Thank you Barolo for staying on top of your game!!"
1705162,"Above average Reuben, but not the best I've ever had. There are many options to build your own sandwich."
1893546,really crowded but great service! loved the food we will be back
1676289,"This is THE BEST steak house within 20 miles Edmonds/Lynnwood. The meat is outstanding and always cooked to perfection. It's aged at least 28 days and you don't need a knife. You expect that with a filet but I recently had their special which was a sirloin and a lobster claw and the sirloin was incredibly tender and very flavorful. 

The service is over the top. Friendly, prompt, attentive and knowledgeable. And if you ever have any issues they immediately bring over the manager and will comp you the meal, dessert or drinks for even the simplest issue. 

Every time I've eaten there the manager has stopped by. 

I have out of town business guests that ask to go back there after they've eaten there once.

And get there early so you can start in the bar for happy hour. The house cab is Jay Lohr and they pour a third of a bottle in a huge glass. Big tasty beers and very good well drinks. 

My family knows a gift card to the Keg will bring a big smile every time."
266323,Great food. Great experiments. Will return without a doubt.
766791,"ahhhhh good ol PASEO!!! The king of all sandwiches in the PNW!!! Where patrons from all walks of life travel down miles and miles away just to wait in an almost always extremely long line just to get their hands on the famous pork shoulder sandwich. Did I mention that it is the best of the best? The baguette has the perfect crunch yet slight fluff, the texture of the pork combined with the succulent flavoring, caramelized onions, jalapeÃ±o-- its a party in my mouth!! Hands down! This is worth any wait. Whether you are visiting during your lunch hour caught between the wait; if you are late upon you're return--tell you're boss it was well worth the tardiness."
810299,"I had dinner here with a co-worker who really talked the place up. Imagine my surprise when we arrived at a restaurant in a sketchy strip mall attached to a gas station. I was even more surprised at the relatively nice interior - don't be fooled by the outside!

Unlike many reviewers, our service was prompt and friendly but it may have helped that we arrived early. I chose the braised beef ravioli in a Demi glacÃ© and was very happy with the dish. It was savory, filling and exactly what I wanted.

Overall, prices (average ~ $20/dish) are a bit high but the wine list is reasonable. I was pleasantly surprised and would happily eat here again."
838775,"You go to this place for its location and to be seen.

The food is average / OKay at best.  The protein portions in the food are dismal.

3 entrees and 3 appetizers were $110 with no alcohol.  REDICULOUS

We won't be back"
847778,"Absolutely top notch. We have been on several occasions to play and staff is always helpful, courteous and attentive. This weekend we had our son's birthday party at the Play Date Cafe. Best party our kids ever had. Terrific value, great space and fun for everyone. We will be back again next year for their birthday for sure! Lizz has done a fantastic job and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Play Date Cafe! Great job!"
1669660,Salmon burger was absolutely amazing. Will definitely be going back to try every other sandwich on the menu.
1645808,"It is exactly what you expect. A good time especially for out of town visitors. A bit pricey for what you get, and our shrimp seemed overlooked."
1445818,"It doesn't matter what you order, it all tastes the same. They use the same noodles for everything, and same dumplings for everything. Super cheap eats, but gross. Extremely doughy and the meat tastes weird. It has this odd sour taste to it. 

Tea is cold, and make sure you have cash. They don't take credit or debit cards."
450473,"While macaron adaptation by Seattle patisseries appears to be gaining momentum, discovering a version that closely adheres to an acceptable level of authenticity remains unfulfilled.

You ask by what criteria I employ? First, Maison LadurÃ©e (globally), and second, 'Lette Macarons (in the States). For more macaron reviews, take a gander at these macaron lists:
http://www.yelp.com/list¦
http://www.yelp.com/list¦

It appears pricing for macarons in Seattle is consistently high compared to other parts of the US, with Honore's version carrying a price tag of $1.90 each. Higher prices usually translates to higher expectations.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦

Honore employs both buttercream and ganache fillings, which is standard practice for macarons. However, a few of their flavors that are usually best interpreted when filled with ganache were not, namely pistachio and framboise.

Pistachio: 2/5
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
Buttercream fillings tend to be much sweeter than their ganache counterpart, and such was the case with Honore's pistachio macaron which faintly represented the essence of pistachio and tasted just too much like sugar. It did, however, possess an ideal lightly crisp shell and an aptly moist cookie chew yet with a slight separation between shell and cookie.

Framboise: 2/5
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
Characteristically, nearly identical to pistachio: too sweet with not enough raspberry flavor. A smaller, odd shaped cookie yet lacked the void found in pistachio.

Chili Chocolate: 4/5
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
The best of the bunch. Ganache filling was smooth yet firm, tasting exactly as advertised. Slight separation between cookie and shell yet possessed ideal chew

Lavender Chocolate: 3.5/5
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
Characteristically close to chili chocolate, being filled with a smooth ganache and slight separation between cookie and shell yet the cookie was a little drier.

Salted Caramel: 2/5
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
Unmistakably caramel but was one of the sweetest versions I've ever tasted. Also, slightly stale with a harder chew.

Coconut Salted Caramel: 1.5/5
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
http://www.yelp.com/biz_¦
The worst of the bunch. Stale, dry, and hard to chew. Of note, there was a distinguishable coconut flavor.

Certainly Honore Artisan Bakery offers much more than macarons, which should garner a higher score. Regrettably, I did not have the opportunity to try their other baked goods or espresso.

Honore will be on my try again list, but until then, the rating stands: 2.5/5"
1325381,"It'd been a really long time since I've been to Palisade, and frankly, I wasn't sure what to expect. We celebrated our 8th anniversary there last night and the service, food and overall environment was, as 5 stars would imply, as good as it gets! There was great attention to detail: the hostess greeting us and saying ""happy anniversary"" when we checked in for our reservation, a nice card waiting at the table, red rose petals, and a nice table that allowed my husband and I to sit comfortably side-by-side so that we could both enjoy the view. We started with the crab cakes, and if you've read any of the Yelp reviews of their crab cakes, you know how amazing these are. It's like eating soft, melt-in-your-mouth cheesey chunks of crab meat: incredible! My husband had the shrimp/lobster bisque which was very rich, but very delicious. I had the avocado/vine tomato salad with Buratta (spelling?). Also very tasty. For the entrees, he had the scallops with risotto and I had the swordfish. The fish was cooked perfectly and the polenta cakes were firm, but moist. My husband's risotto was delicious, but that's where the sharing ended. Sadly, he did not offer up a scallop, but I suspect they were good since both of our dishes looked like they didn't need to be washed after we finished our meal. Service was attentive, but not pushy or rushed. This is a really nice place for a special occasion--yes, a little pricey but well worth it. Oh, and I can't end this review without recommending the Pink Lady cocktail. Yummmm!"
1709697,"I've tasted Can-Am's pizza at their Bothell location a couple of times and my experience has been good. So while driving by Bellevue, I called in to order a butter chicken pizza for pick up without any hesitation. 

Well, we were very disappointed with the quality of what we received. The pizza was half-cooked, tasted like raw wet flour, and I felt like it was a complete waste of time and money. Would not recommend."
1815133,"A hidden jewel in Edmonds - incredibly well prepared food, killer drinks, great staff with no turnover, cozy venue.

First of all, I'm not a first timer here, just lazy in getting around to posting.  Having been here many times (my kitchen remodel lasted for three plus months.... Bar Dojo became nearly a hangout), it's easy to explain what I love about this place.

The staff.  Host/owner is friendly, casual, yet thorough and speedy.  Never waited more than two minutes to be seated, and that day, the two minute delay was because one of their waitstaff called in sick.  Plus, another restaurant opened nearby, and was having problems getting their kitchen in order, and he went in to help them out.  Think about that for a sec...and then watch how engaged the waitstaff is.

    Waitstaff consists of just a few people.  They have no real turnover of people - they love this place, and they earn their place here.  Barkeeps are friendly, fast, and they have the presence of mind to help get the food out when there's a big table.  When you see that  in action, you know you're being served by a great team!

Atmosphere.  Upscale casual.  No white tablecloths.  Wood tables and chairs, mostly 2 and 4 tops, spaced well, no chair-bumping during meals. Have been in there with well behaved kids (usually age 8+), but rarely.  Only one large party table up front.  Bar area connected to dining area, with about 8 barstools at the bar for those focusing on the liquids.  OpenTable works for instant reservations, though I've had excellent luck just walking in.

Menu.  Asian fusion, done not-quite-over-the-top, but mind-blowing for this sleepy neighborhood in Edmonds!  Precisely spiced - you get exactly what you ask for.  Flavors in every dish are so broad and full they defy description.  Last night, I had the Seafood Bowl, which included seared Ahi crusted with a full-flavored, but not too spicy layer of deliciousness.    Scallops seared to perfection, marinated shrimp full of flavor to their center... again, not a weak dish to be found
    My wife normally leans toward one of the noodle bowls, curried or otherwise.  Again, broad list of ingredients and spices keep things interesting, but not so much that they get confused.  Great balance of flavors and textures throughout.
    A dear friend joined us last night, and decided on the sliders appetizer as her entrÃ©e.  She bit into it, and closed her eyes for a few seconds, enjoying it in silence.  The cilantro aioli knocked her socks off.  Another Bar Dojo convert.  

Drinks.  I'd like to be able to say that I've sampled the drink menu widely, but I haven't.  Had a few standard mixed cocktails in my first visits, but then tried the Liquid Swordsman.  Now, I can't order anything else.  A mix of Hendrick's gin, lime juice, and Cointreau, the mouth feel of this drink is rich and full, and the flavors come in waves of sweetness, and mild herbal notes.  Do yourself a favor and order one.  Best.Drink.Ever.

Price.  This is not a noodle house, it is a top-notch restaurant and bar tucked into my quiet neighborhood.  Dinner for two, with drinks, normally runs about $60 or so. Prices are spot-on, in my opinion, based on the consistent quality and clear attention to detail.  

Want to impress your significant other while not having to fight I-5 S to Seattle, and also show how you can find the secret gems of culinary delight?  Hit Bar Dojo."
946222,"Very nice view of the water while dining!  The city lights make a beautiful back drop at night!  Tried the clam chowder, the chicken and the salmon rice plates.  The clam chowder was okay but nothing spectacular.  The chicken was not my kind of food and the salmon ironically tasted like it was not fresh.

We came here for the view, but I would recommend other restaurants at the Pike Place market for view.

Price is not expensive but the food is definitely not worth it."
1190980,"My husband and i just moved to the area and we were looking for a good dinner place since we had been unpacking all day.

We drove around town and saw this gorgeous building and thought it would be good.
It is very basic food in our opinion, a bit pricey for what you're getting. We split a steak entree and the meat was very fatty, we asked for med rare- it came back overcooked. We also ordered dessert and found a piece of paper (plastic wrapping) in the cookie pie.

Customer service was excellent, and everyone there is professional the food is just seriously lacking."
2424317,"So I don't get the hype with this place. With the great reviews I was expecting the food to taste amazing. My usual pho place was closed for the summer and I was craving some pho, so I decided to check this place out based on the yelp reviews. The pho broth was very bland that I had to put so much seasonings in it. So disappointed. I was also turned off by the person taking my order at the register. He was fixing the food and delivering them to the tables, but also chewing gum with his mouth open. I did not appreciate that. And the bathrooms were filthy. If the bathrooms were dirty, I'd hate to imagine what the kitchen looks like! I'll stick to my go-to pho place in Silverdale."
1112789,"The beer is amazing, the food is good...but the service is pitiful! I was served a beer 20 minutes ago and I have been trying to get the waitress to take my Happy Hour order, but she keeps passing by me like I don't exist. I have tried to get her attention, but apparently sipping her drink at the bar with the other staff is more important. :-( Disappointed."
797106,"Dot's is fabulous, both their menu and their products.  Porchetta sandwich to die for, mussels delish, love those greens, and of course the fries.  Am working my way through the menu.  Love having curated selection of wine and my kid loves the non-alcoholic ginger beer.  I always bring Seattle visitors.  My secret vice is the chicken liver mousse."
1648636,"I wasn't planning on writing a review, was just curious about other's thoughts as I took my granddaughter for her 4th birthday today.  Her mom was not excited about going as we have  had terrible experiences at other locations out of state.
But hey, it was her birthday so we figured even if the food was bad, it would be fun for her.

The hostess let us scope out the place for several minutes to make sure that she and her 2 year old brother wouldn't be frightened.  She let us pick wherever we wanted which was a complete shock because so many restaurants tell you that ""only this part is available for seating.""

So, having very low expectations for the food, we were surprised and impressed!  We thought all the food was perfect, unlike the Red Robin we went to last month which was so horrible they didn't charge us for the entire meal!

When my granddaughter's dessert came so did lots of staff members to sing to her!
OK, all  said, I do admit the service was crazy slow........to the point where we were walking the kids around waiting.....tooooo long!!  And we did have to ask again for things several times, but our waiter was very kind and it was not his fault he was overworked!
Go with kids and enjoy the food and let them enjoy the atmosphere, but just expect you will be there a long time."
2163048,"I won't lie, I was a little weary coming here after reading some of the reviews. However, now that I've eaten here I can say I'm very happy I did. 

My boyfriend and I came here during our trip to Seattle. It was so cute! It has a large, open setting with a small patio. You order your food first and then sit down with a number to wait for your food. Sadly, we arrived too late for breakfast, but ordered a breakfast type sandwich to accommodate our breakfast needs. We also ordered their meatball sub. Both orders came out in a timely manner. The breakfast sandwich, which was delicious, consisted of scrambled eggs with gruyere on a delicious, soft homemade biscuit with a side of greens. The meatball sub was served at the perfect tempature and was very flavorful (it also came with a side salad). It tasted as if the meatballs were made out of sausage meat - very yummy! 

Great ambiance, delicious food, good customer service, and fun for people watching! My boyfriend and I will definitely come back."
1113076,"Great Thai food--by my estimation (and word-of-mouth), possibly the best in Seattle. Definitely try the seasonal specials on the first (paper) page of the menu--during fall the Pumpkin Pad Thai is delicious (not peanut based), as well as the papaya salad. For those who like it hot, ordering your dishes with the maximum 4 stars will not give you gastritis--so ask for extra sauce on the side (a tasty 4-sampler).
Minus 1/2-star for screaming children who are often dragged here by their parents (I would too--the food is that good).
Also, if at all possible, weekdays are preferable, as it can get busy quickly."
1932810,"I can't believe I hadn't been here before. I always pass it but with all of the newer, nicer looking restaurants in Mill Creek Town Center, this one always gets overlooked. This restaurant is located next to where the old Zen Garden was in a shoddy little strip mall. You can't miss it with the bright green sign out front.

They have a happy hour during the week that you can order two items for $12. I was skeptical at first because I was anticipating really small portions but I was surprisingly stuffed after the two. The special came with miso soup which was included in the $12 price. Then, I had the veggie/tofu tempura roll and the chicken yakisoba. I would definitely order both again. My friend ended up ordering two rolls and then ordered a third but couldn't finish it.

The service was nice, the place was clean. I will definitely be back. It is probably some of the better sushi available in the area."
224294,"This place gets the gold medal in all-around. It's reliable. It's feasible to walk-in and sit in the bar area or even a table, unplanned in advance. There are enough fun cocktails to suit whatever mood you are in. The fish is terrific, people are friendly and cool. They have a solid happy hour early evening and late night. If you like fun and crazy rolls, they have some of those. But if you are a purist and prefer fresh sashimi, they've got that covered. But some of my favorite finds here are the shishito peppers, the grilled shiitake mushrooms, their version of a pimm's cup, and the composed nigiri. These have become staples in my moshi moshi diet."
2148028,"We arrived on time and was immediately seated. The host spread flower pedals on the table and gave a nice birthday card, The environment is nice. We had a candlelight dinner looking into at the water and the Fremont bridge. We were greeted by the server. I thought this would be a nice birthday dinner for my wife. Little did I know that the service to follow would not be a pleasant as our initial. 
Server came back 15 minutes later to take our order. We were busy looking out so we did not mind waiting to order.  He stated he would be right back with bread. Again, we waited some time for bread to arrive. We waited again for our salad and apps. Server was too busy. There were 5 other tables filled in the restaurant, almost half filled on a Monday at 7pm. Our food was served by runner. I enjoyed the beet salad and mussels. I had some of my wife's fish dish and tartar. The fish was bland and not properly deboned. Ended up swallowing a bone, which scratched at my throat all night. We were finished and asked for the dessert menu. Again, the wait. We order dessert and a latte. The trio custard was so good. The latte was a cap and we flagged down the busser for sugar. Best service came from the busser, server was way below par. When it came time to pay, we waited for the server to run the credit card but after dropping off the credit card, our server became more attentive as I was filling out their review. 
I would not return. I think Seattle has so many better dining experiences. I am very disappointed at the food and server. Food was not worth the moderate price tag."
227760,"My friend, sister, and I were on the hill one Saturday night and were starving! We stopped in at Oddfellows but there was a 20 minute wait so we went elsewhere. We wandered into Poquitos and was able to get a table in the bar right away. The menu looked like there was something for everyone. 

I saw chicharrones on the menu and I immediately knew I had to order them! They were different from any other chicharrones I've had so far. They were big pieces of fried pork skin and they were still warm when they got to the table. They were seasoned with  salt and chile - the perfect combination. 

I also had the Grande Tostada with chorizo.  I should have paid more attention to the description because I was not expecting it to be so ginormous! It's a great appetizer to share. There is so much going on (beans, lettuce, tomato, chorizo, avocado sauce, cheese, and hot sauce) but everything seems to work together and is surprisingly light compared to other Mexican dishes. 

The service was pretty good considering that they were super busy. Our water glasses could have gotten filled quicker, but other than that, the service was spot on. 

I'm interested in trying their chicken mole enchiladas next time. I love me some mole!"
684943,"I really wanted to like this place.  A new hot spot in the Ballard area - a big BBQ joint is usually a first sign of ""not the best BBQ""
I've been across the nation and perhaps I hold too high of standard when it comes to BBQ considering my standard is midwest BBQ (more specifically St. Louis wet rub). 
A good sign of a good BBQ joint - are the smells.  Walking into KBWK i couldn't taste the aroma.  I didn't salivate. I didn't crave BBQ.
This is a dry rub BBQ joint, and slow smoked so the ribs aren't the stick to your ribs while falling off the bone style (which i love).  The BBQ sauce was a little too tangy and the flavors didn't necessarily stick to the meat itself.

My friend and I shared the mixed platter:

Brisket - cooked well. not dried out. but not full of flavor either. dunking and drenching it in the selection of sauces on the table helped a bit but i'm picky and I like my brisket juicy and full of flavor and not needing additional sauce.

Hot links - tasted all the same as any other hot link. had a good amount of spice and bit to it but again, nothing to set it apart from any other link i've tried.

BBQ Chicken - cooked perfectly.  Juicy, tender, no pink.  This actually had a good amount of flavor as well.  I was impressed.

Pulled Pork - same result at the brisket... okay in flavor and decent texture but still nothing that you would crave.

BBQ Pork Ribs - i'm a wet rub fall off the bone fan.  This is dry rubbed, slow smoked.  still lacking full BBQ flavor.  You know its not that good when you don't want to lick your fingers afterwards - instead grab a wet nap and wipe it off.

The mac n cheese was cheesy... but a little too runny.  Almost same taste and texture as a heavily cheesed Hamburger Helper taste.  I highly doubt it was made from scratch.

The collard greens was disappointingly cooked in vinegar and oil... true southern style would have been pork fat and bacon bits!

There are many other places I would choose for BBQ before making a trek out to Ballard for some mediocre BBQ.

With a packed house its hard to find a table and its a free for all in the bar - gets a little too packed and you can find it hard to get consistent service.  But overall - it's a good place to check out and hang out in Ballard.  And a great place if your a fan of Whiskey as they have the largest selection I've ever seen - too bad i'm a Vodka fan :P"
916021,"3 stars seems a bit high, but 2 a bit low. The most clear issue with the burger is the thin veneer of beef they use - that's the whole point of a burger, isn't it? The quality of the ingredients was good for a small burger shack. The onions were crisp, tomato's fresh and the bun had a good taste. I just wish I got more than a good veggie burger with a thin slice of meat."
815179,"Ever since this restaruant moved I am  not impressed.  The bar is actually a nicer place to eat than the restaruant part which seems cold and not well kept.  The service isn't as good as it used to be either, they seem to be unexperienced. The food is disappointing also, it seems like they have lowered their standards."
162840,"Love Palisade. Went here for the first time for the Yelp event celebrating the restaurant's 20th birthday, and have since been back to enjoy their excellent happy hour. All the food is really well executed, service is friendly and prompt, and the view of the Seattle waterfront is pretty darn excellent. Nothing bad to say."
1728789,"Took my wife here for our Valentines Day dinner.

The atmosphere is totally our style, live the design of the website and menu too. 

I was excited when I saw they had Old Fashion cocktail but it wasn't exactly what I expected (had one at The Polar Bar that was awesome).

We had pork belly sliders for a appetizer and I ordered the spaghetti with oysters and white sauce. My wife had the rabbit lions wrapped in bacon. Awesome, awesome.

It was all quite expensive but an awesome experience."
174465,"Well here is a good spot. I've been meaning to come here for some time and finally did. They have one of the largest whisky collections on the West Coast and the largest Absinthe collection in North America. Have the green dragon, it will blow your mind, man. The reality is that you have to drink a ton of Absinthe for any of the hallucinogenic effects. 

The staff here is very knowledgable and entertaining. If you're friendly and down to earth, then I think that's the right combo to strike up a thoughtful conversation. If you are sort of touristy or the business type, then they will be polite and friendly and willing to take your money from you. It's like a choose your own adventure book. Fortunately for myself and my 2 companions that I was here with, we are down to earth folks so it was quite a nice time sitting at the bar and chatting with the bartender in between his cocktail crafting. 

I could come here time and time again to try whisky and various cocktails that they have on the menu. The guy that we were chatting with I think used to work at Bastille or something but not sure. He was great."
860346,"I've had an ""ah-hah"" moment about restaurants thanks to Vios.

We have a 20 month old and moved to Capital Hill last May so of course everyone has recommended this place.  

We finally went last night before Ash Wednesday Mass.  We got there at 6 p.m. and managed to thoroughly enjoy ourselves in less than an hour in order to make the 7 p.m. service.

Our server promptly greeted us and immediately offered to take our son's order (wise man!) in advance. They offered 3 items on the kids menu - spaghetti and meatballs, mac n cheese and a mini Greek plate with hummus, pita bread, etc.   By this time of course our son had left us for the play area which was adjacent to our booth - GENIUS!  

Our server then showed us the $20/bottler wine list (are you kidding me?) and we selected a delicious Montelpulciano.  This was off to a great start!

For the adult meal we ordered a fresh and authentic Greek Salad, the vegetarian mousakka which was perfection and the chicken souvlaki (also very good).

We considered dessert but ran out of time.

In short, we adults were able to have a delicious meal, drink good (cheap) wine, and delight in watching our son play with other kids and have a great time.  He ate his kid's meal as well mind you although I can see how kids might be too distracted with playtime to eat.

What occurred to me is how easy it would be for more restaurants to follow suit with a play area.  It couldn't have comprised more than 80 square feet which in my opinion pays for itself in rent due to the convenience and joy it serves for families (hence my ""ah-hah"" moment mentioned above).

And until other restaurants do the same, we are more than happy to continue dining at Vios and look forward to trying more of their delicious menu items and enjoying their friendly service!"
1262520,"This place was yummy! I ordered a foot long Baja chicken and that was way to much food. For a normal person, save yourself the time and money and get a six inch. Freshly made, hot and worth every cent. This place is tucked away on the side of a shopping mall so it's not in a convenient  spot or you'll  have to search for it."
1240614,"This little restaurant serves delicious, fresh food quickly and accurately.  They even deliver within a three-mile radius, which is a real luxury around here.  My favorite is their greek salad with chicken.  It is always crisp and fresh, with delicious grilled chicken, a vinaigrette dressing, plus tzatziki and homemade breadsticks.  It's addictive.  My husband prefers the gyros, which are also delicious.  I should try other things - I've heard their pizza is amazing, but I really like the salad.  Service is friendly and quick.  If we call our order in, it's ready when we get there.  This is a great locally-owned restaurant.  You should try it!"
839770,"Tom's review two days ago was spot on. I wanted to give this place another shot after a less than stellar visit a couple of months ago.  The place wasn't even half full and yet the scene behind the register was chaos. Three teens were standing behind the counter, all trying to figure out the cash register, while one of them remarked ""how do you work this thing"" - then I noticed that they were microwaving crepe ingredients. I am a huge crepe fan but knew that based on what I was seeing in front of me today, the food and service wouldn't be any better than the last time.  Owner should bring in someone who knows how to make crepes. And also staff who know how to operate a cash register."
914413,I was driving southbound I5 And craving donuts. This place isn't too far off the freeway. I would never have gone here just by driving by. I promise you will not be disappointed. Ignore the appearance and focus on the delicious donuts!!!
1108797,"Finally a pizza that tastes like a slice of home. I'm an east coaster and this goes up against any pizza I've had in New York. Crust is perfect, just enough sauce. 

The only reasons I didn't give 5 stars is because I was a little disappointed with their meatball sub. Definitely needed more sauce and the ricotta cheese was just weird. It wasn't *bad* just wasn't what I expected... the decor could use a little work... come on guys... it's not the 80s anymore... and the prices are a little on the high side.

But their pizza is REALLY good. A MUST try if other local pizza joints have failed to impress."
1834801,"Probably the best burger place on the Ave, I thought it was better than EJ's. It wasn't nearly as messy and the ingredients seemed to be fresher. The double bacon cheeseburger is my new favorite. Oh also their shakes are amazing, definitely try the Oreo!"
1031417,"Upon entering, we were promptly greeted, seated and offered drinks. Soon after, we were diving into spicy fries, fried calamari, spinach dip and corn frie oysters! So delicious. Definitely get the spicy fries! This place is easy to get to and there is ample parking in front of the store front or in the extra Fred Meyers parking."
1286102,"La Isla is my favorite restaurant in Redmond. Friendly staff, great food and a fantastic happy hour twice a day. Their drinks are also delicious. The tripleta sandwich is amazing and probably my favorite thing on the menu besides the pastelon, their Puerto Rican lasagna. Nice space and great location in downtown Redmond. I highly recommend it!"
2197190,"Stopped in here for HH. The cocktail of the day was a watermelon puree w/ lemon vodka (simple syrup and soda water) and it was exceptionally tasty. I believe we ended up have 3 rounds of it. Daily cocktails are $3 off during hh and it runs from 2:30-6. Perfect for those who are looking for a late lunch or early snack. 

We opted for the short ribs, tuna tartare, kale chips, and the boka salad. 

Boka salad wasnt anything special and the tuna tartare was okay, but I'm not sure I'd order it again. The short ribs were 2 giant pieces marinated in a tasty sauce. Very very good, could've been a main meal on it's own. I enjoyed the kale chips that were served w/ shaved parmasen on top. 

Service was fantastic, our waitress, with the pretty eyes and key necklace, was helpful, friendly, and fun to talk to which made the experience so much better.

Didn't try the truffle fries this time around, but I walked by a table that had ordered them and they smelled divine."
2145052,"Seattle Trip Feb 2013:

We all came here for my birthday dinner. Most of us decided to do the Dinner Pre-fixe menu which is a 3-course tasting for $35 and we were surprised how much we could select from! 

Cauliflower soup (1st course): It was pretty good. I think the best bites were when there was bits of dungeness crab on top. YUM-O! But.... once the crab was gone, you were left with cauliflower soup. Hmm... needs more crab. Plus it needed some salt. Am I losing my tastebuds?!?!! A lot of my reviews keep talking about this lack of salt lol

Dungeness Crab with grapefruit salad (1st course): My friend got this. It actually wasn't that bad. There was a lighttness to it but I didn't finish it but my friend seemed to enjoy it.

Savory Crawfish beignets (2nd course): The best I've ever tasted! OMG... I was like.. really? Savory beignets... ha! But you eat it and surprisingly everything words. The flavors are magnificient! Then again, anything fried is good haha

Homemade Boar Garlic Sausage (2nd): It was pretty good. You didn't really get the game-iness that you probably would get with wild animal meats but this one wasn't that bad. My friends liked it but I prefered the beignets.

Tuna tartare (2nd): Two of my friends got it. I usually like raw tuna, but I think because the tartare was sort of warm that I didn't like it as much. My friends liked it but I prefer my tuna to be colder in temperature.

Fried boar boudin Boulettes (2nd): My brother got this one, it tasted just like the boar sausage above except it was in 3 balls with some sauce. We were like this is it? It's so small, but it tasted nice.

Risotto (3rd): My friend got it, and by far it tasted the best out of all the dishes we had gotten in the 3rd course. I gotta say, wow! I loved this dish. It was creamy and just bonafide delicious.

Ricotta Gnocchi (3rd): Hmm... I liked it. It was really acidic in flavor which I liked at times, but I sort of wanted a creamier feel when eating this gnocchi. I liked the fresh gnocchi, it was really good. It was the rest of the dish where the flavors were so acidic that I didn't really want to finish it.

Snapper (3rd): My brother got this one, he really liked it. It was spicy and I didn't get to try all the components but from my bite, it tasted pretty good. 

Duck and potatoes (3rd): Two of my friends go this one. Omg, I usually don't like duck but I really like how this duck tasted. It was sooo bomb! My friends didn't finish it but ended up taking it back to the apartment and ate it later on and it was so good as leftovers, I wish I had gotten the duck! 

Bottomline: a good place to try and the $35 pre-fixe dinner menu ain't too bad either. On a budget? Just get a single dish under $20"
1644384,"they are dishonest on the weight!!! we ordered 3pounds of shrimp and clamsï¼ but actually they just gave us half of them!! also, the food tasted not so good, just soso~"
1771948,Loved Daniel's tonight. Great friendly service. My prime rib was superbly delicious and my wife's filet was outstanding.  Lindsay was a great waitress for the night. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone coming to Seattle. The hot fudge Sunday with Olympia coconut ice cream was to die for.
1692530,"I want to like Topside, but without the deck it is just a sub-par restaurant. The menu is pretty sparse and a little expensive for what you get. My wife got a burger that was super dry and weird tasting. I ordered the fish and chips and was told they are out of them. This is the third time this has happened to me. This place has so much potential, is super clean, and the staff is pretty nice (tonight waitress was average and a little slow, but usually they are great). I keep coming back because I'm a local and want it to be good, but I am consistently dissapointed. Please get better. You have so much potential.."
818940,One of my favorite sushi spots. Have yet to try a roll I don't like! This place is usually pretty quiet so the service is quick. I hate waiting for a seat!
2159553,"I was really looking forward to good sushi during my trip to Seattle, but I was left a bit disappointed. My friends love this place and I get that, but they put wasabi on every piece of sushi and for someone with a sensitivity to spicy foods, I would prefer to have had control over the wasabi. It was all I tasted. So I couldn't really enjoy the fish. I think I would go back because I like the traditional atmosphere, but I would request that they not put wasabi on everything."
796208,"From the food to the service, this place was absolutely amazing. Get the bottom if the forest floor. 100% fresh ingredients and the pasta was cooked perfectly. By far the best pasta dish I have EVER had in my entire life. The place is exactly in the name but that's what makes it fun. I go out to eat not just for food, but for an experience. This place would be great for first dates because quirky decor is a great icebreaker."
870022,"The food is ok, nothing too special."
175875,"The service was fantastic and the food was alright! I haven't been in years but I do remember it being a bit better before. Still, our party had a fun time and the private room was pretty nice and intimate. 

Still, I'd choose a few other nearby favorites before coming back. I have no huge complaints but no amazing impression with the sushi was left either."
1032892,"The cutest little hole in the wall restaurant in Burien! Thank God for Yelp, because when I saw all the good reviews Captain G's had, I knew that that's where I'd go for lunch. And good thing I did - the food was AWESOME. And even better, my friend & I fell in love with Captain G! He's the sweetest shop owner, we had some good conversation, over an amazing Turkish meal. If you're ever in B-Town & have a hankering for Med. food - hit up Captain G's! You will not be sorry. 
My friend and I split the Chicken Kebob & it was more than enough for the both of us! 
Thank you Gencay for the great service!"
2154215,"Stopped in here for dinner after a long day of house hunting.  We were starving, and this place hit the spot!  The grilled crab with ponzu sauce was amazing.  I'd come back over and over just for that.  The sushi was fresh and delicious and they had some new roll combinations I hadn't seen before.  The atmosphere was very lively, seems like a good place to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks."
962406,"Lunch at Lombardi's this Labor Day weekend was so disappointing that I cannot imagine our going back there again.  My husband ordered a regular item on the lunch menu: ""Spaghettini al Pomodoro,"" and, it was a good thing that he ordered the two meatballs for an extra $3.  The entree was served in a dish slightly larger than a cereal bowl with hardly any spaghetti under the meatballs.  I had to share part of the pasta that I ordered, which was ""Spaghetti Vera Sano,"" ostensibly special because of its vegetable mixture of asparagus, pine nuts, peas, etc. but I didn't see much except the zucchini.  And definitely no asparagus, let alone pine nuts. 
What a shame!  We've been going to Lombardi's for years.  The service and ambience have not changed, but the food has certainly has. I hope they get a new chef or send the current one to a refresher course on Italian cuisine.
Maria W."
2148326,"Their breakfast is very good, but the service and wait is ridiculously slow.  They have a very good chorizo scramble which is delicious and their Little Richard breakfast is very good.  If you have the time to wait, it is worth going here, otherwise it's not.  It's always packed in the morning and there is always at least a half hour wait just to get a table then at least another half hour to get your food,"
1949554,"1. The wait staff was not very warm upon greeting.
2. The breakfast fair was healthy and fresh but really over priced for eggs, veggies and beans. 
3. The coffee was good, but I don't go to Mexican breakfast for the coffee.
4. THEY DON'T SERVE FLOUR TORTILLAS. ? How can you eat nopales con huevos without a flower tortilla to pick it up with??

We may try it again for dinner because it's close but only for the Ballard convenience. Still looking for the great hole-in-the-wall Mexican food in Seattle."
825436,"Went here for lunch and it was scrumptious. We started with the tabbouleh, which was as fabulous as last time. They had a cauliflower kuku as a special (kind of like a frittata) that was absolutely amazing. Very flavorful and great texture. Then we had the lamb mana'eesh, which was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the pomegranate. For dessert, we split a piece of nut bil seniyeh, which also had a great texture and was flavorful and not too sweet. This was a perfect amount of food for 2 people. And the hibiscus tea is quite good too."
2151241,"We loved it here!!  Our first night in Seattle and it tasted so good.  You can't come here without ordering the bread.  Sourdough with butter was not bad, would have been better if it was warm.  The smelt dish was insane.  If you know smelt, this was so fresh and the lemon zest made it next level.  Next dish was the lobster mushrooms,  simple yet flavorful.  The next dish was the loxs.  The lox plate was very flavorful, borderline  salty if you don't chase it with the arugula.  After that came the main course.  My wife got the cod and it was really fresh, melted in your mouth.  The pork was so tender that I was cutting it with a butter knife.  So much free stuff and the service was better then most places.  We love this place!!  People that hate on this place didn't have reservations."
953547,"First thing ... yes it is expensive, but it is also the best 2 and a half hours for my money. Rule of thumb - expect to spend $100 per person ... a little more if you order a bottle of wine.

The service is very good ... they are very attentive, knowledgeable, and compliant ... when asked to give us 15 minutes to enjoy our drinks before taking our food order, the server basically said very good, went away and then promptly returned 15 minutes later to take our order ... there is no rush from the staff, I set the pace.

The ambiance is very nice ... especially with the piano player. The lighting varies quite a bit ... some areas are better lit than other. If there is anything I would like the management to address is the lighting issue ... when you see guests using small pen flashlights to read the menu, that area is just too dark.

My favorite thing about my time at El Gaucho is their great wine list ... I would guess they have at least 100 wines to choose from, with prices ranging from about $40 to $800 a bottle. Needless to say, their mix drink choices are pretty expansive as well.

My experience with the food has always been very good and my meal is always prepared as I ordered it. My favorite entree is a tie between the Rack of Lamb and the Rib Chop (bone-in Ribeye) cooked to ""Rare-plus.""  I'd be hard pressed to name another restaurant that can prepare either of these two entree's better than El Gaucho ... and I've been to many very fine restaurants in the United States.

So, yes it is expensive here. But remember, you're actually paying for the whole experience of fine dinning ... and not just for the food and drinks."
693663,I came here with my friend for dine around Seattle for Lunch. We need reservations and was seated promptly. We got a menu and  our water but literally waited 15 minutes for our waitress. We had to hail a busser down to ask for our server. Our server took our order and brought out a small appetizer for us for taking so long. The food was really good all 3 courses.
101239,"Bahama Breeze is pretty bomb for a chain food restaurant.  The drinks are delicious and not too pricey, the menu is large, and all of the food options are pretty scrumptious.  

I've been to Bahama Breeze for lunch and they offer a great menu.  The flatbread is really yummy.  Most recently when I went I ordered off the small plates menu and had pulled pork over fried sweet plantains. It was so good.  

My husband loves onion rings so he always orders those.  The portion size is humongous.  Seriously, it could feed a table of 5-6 people.  We brought home leftovers and split it as a side between three people the next night.

The only things I've not been a fan of has been their burgers and I ordered a seasonal stone crab that wasn't very good.  The crab was dry and the burger patties are just not up to par.  My husband has ordered a burger from there twice and not happy either times.  I think he forgot he didn't care for it the last time.

Despite those two lows, I have to give a shout out to the Bahama Rita which comes with a side car of extra booze to add to the delicious frozen concoction.  Also, the veggie press sandwich, as well as the Wood Grilled Chicken Breast.  I never order chicken when I go out, but I decided to try this because I liked that it came with broccoli and a baked sweet potato.  It sounds plain and boring but it's not.  The Citrus butter sauce that is on the chicken is so delicious.  It also comes in a ""lighter"" portion, which I get because the normal side is ginormous.  Even with the lighter portion, I take home half of it. 

Yum, this review is making me hungry!"
1728031,Pretty good BBQ. I love that it is small owner operated. Although the staff was very courteous they seemed annoyed by the restaurant.com coupon we had. We enjoyed the food and the family home atmosphere was such a nice change from the typical Seattle area restaurant. It really felt like we were in someones home. We will be back- maybe without the coupon.
674297,"holy freaking cow i am stuffed! came here to celebrate my job offer and boy was it good. we all opted to go for the buffet brunch line while a couple of us got some mimosas and a beer. going from the buffet line there were pea salad, waldorf salad, pesto pasta with salami, cold shrimp and crab legs, smoked salmon and bagels and cream cheese, a made to order area for pancakes that include: blueberry, chocolate chip, banana mac nut, mac nut and original pancakes, a section of sushi, scones, biscuits, mini muffins and croissants, and a dessert table that included strawberry and pineapple skewered fruits for chocolate dipping, chocolate mousse, 3 kinds of creme brulee (chocolate, vanilla bean and gran marnier) as well as mini cheesecake bites and mini fudge bites and chocolate chip cookies

i was a BIG fan of the shrimp and thank God it was a buffet because they were soooo good. the shrimp were cooked nicely so they were plump and juicy. the cocktail sauce was BOMB! it was nice and tangy with a touch of spice which gave the shrimp so much flavor, it was amaze balls. the crab legs were kinda small which wasn't expected but still yielded pretty good meat. i felt like i had to eat it because it was crab .. at a buffet if you know what i mean. 

the pesto pasta salad was pretty good. there was a cheese in there along side the salami but i couldn't make out what it was. there were cheese plates too. i opted for the white cheddar and the gouda. always a good and safe choice. 

i tried a banana mac nut and a regular mac nut pancake, both were real good. they were nice and fluffy but i couldn't definitely taste the grease they used to get those pancakes not to stick. thumbs down. they had a pineapple butter that was good but maybe i should have used some maple syrup. idk. maybe it would have been nice with like coconut syrup! maybe i should suggest it for next time. 

they kept the biscuits and croissants coming out of the oven nice and hot. biscuits were finished with some salt on the top which was a nice finish against the jam/berry butter i spread on there. from what i understand, the scones were not the business.

i didn't eat the sushi, salmon or bagels with cream cheese. however, the dessert bar was pretty good. i really enjoyed the vanilla bean creme brulee along side the strawberry and pineapple chocolate dipped skewers. the chocolate mousse, cheesecake, fudge bites, lemon custard stuff and cookies were just okay or else non edible. 

all in all it was a pretty successful all you can eat brunch at $28 a person. i will be coming back but maybe in a long while. i'm still stuffed."
1238891,"Celebrated Special Occasion here. The menu items seems to be a hit or miss depending on what you choose. For example, we ordered the goat cheese and beet salad and it was absolutely disgusting, but the clams and mussel appetizer was absolutely delicious (with a generous portion for the price). Our entrees of the lasagna and spaghetti bolognase were really tasty as well, however the cheesecake dessert was not worth the calories or the price. Bottom line stick to something familiar and you'll do just fine."
869785,"Truley, I am a fan of this establishment. Best $5 meal around.  I really like the way they season their chicken, and I think that the half half quesadilla is a great value.

The only reason that I do not give it 5 stars is that sometimes they skimp on the veggie mix in nachos and salads. The first time I tried to order double veggie mix it looks like the same amount. The next time I went, I ordered one double and one regular (as an experiment) and both salads looked identical.  I can't give you 4 stars if my vegetarian friends don't want to eat there. Hopefully, someone will read this and talk about veggie mix portioning."
784551,"I am from baltimore Maryland, and I was told by friends that this was a must visit place to go while in Seattle.  When we got their we sat down at the bar and looked over the menu. It was very impressive with all the varieties of cocktails and fun food items. I was extremely disappointed because we sat at the bar for over 15 minutes and the bartender never came over to us. She made eye contact with us several times but never felt the need to take our order. So after 20 minutes we got up and left. It was a shame. The menu looked great."
965459,"The food rocked.  The service was okay.  We ended up having 6 in our party instead of 4 or 5, so we were a little squished, no big deal.  However, we asked for an extra set of silverware twice before the food was delivered, and again after it was delivered and finally got a set.  They were medium busy, and the food was delicious.  Think maybe the waitress just wasn't on her game.  She was pleasant and in an overall good mood, as well as the hostess and other staff members we saw.  I'll definitely go back.  The link sausage was delicious and not as greasy as most places."
178492,"Bar & Grill? There's a Grill? Hmmm, I don't think so, but strong drinks and good variety of music compared to Neighbours's boring house music. Cute go-go boys that aren't starved like at Social"
895152,This was our 2nd visit and we pigged out.  The quality of the sushi is excellent.  My friends keep telling me this place is cheap compared to other local sushi places.
861829,Not the best Vegetarian sandwich restaurant.  Excellent for meat eaters.
1755250,"The quality of the chicken pad thai me amd my boyfriend had was on par. However, I am a wimp when it comes to spice so we got a level 2, and it was still too spicy. He really liked it, which is why I rated it a 3 but I was not a fan of the flavor. Hopefully they will wow me with another dish next time!"
944294,"Worst service ever!!  Came in and were seated... waited literally a half hour and never had our order taken.  An older lady came by several times and kept saying ""Oh you guys haven't had your order taken?""  but nothing ever happened.  There were four other people busy setting a table or two... finally after I got over my astonishment... we got up and left.  I've eaten at the eggs nest before and the food was pretty good but each time the service has gotten worse... after this visit I won't be returning."
1925393,"Been here twice now and my husband and I are planning on making it our regular brunch/lunch spot. The bartender James is awesome even when he is busy he is friendly, talkative and super great at suggesting menu items."
1320453,"The dude on the grill was super cool and everything was prepared in a presentable way, but the flavors just weren't there. I've had some great Lebanese food and I've had some merely ok Lebanese food and Shawarma King isn't in the former category."
1266605,"This was my first time eating out in Seattle. I just happened to walk by and this place caught my eye. Might not have seen it except for the musician who was sitting outside that caught my ear first. He was definitely not employed by the establishment but was keeping a great beat. 
I was greeted at the door and promptly told by the hostess that they had a full house coming at 1830 and that seating me might be a problem. It was 1650 and the place was completely empty except for two other tables. I told the hostess that being a party of one- I would be finished in plenty of time. Not sure why I didn't walk away at this point but it was intriguing inside so I stayed. This was the only issue I had this evening.
Victoria was my waitress and a delight. She made up for the meeting at the door. I ordered a glass of wine and she had me drinking within 2 min. 
I ordered the butternut squash- which I don't normally like but the way she described it made me want to try. Delicious! I don't know when I have enjoyed a soup so much. It was silky smooth and so full of flavor. 
Next I ordered the fried pickles. The menu states that they make their own pickles and their own fresh batter. They came out piping hot and so lightly breaded that they were flaky. I would say that normally the batter makes the fried pickle but in this case they compliment each other. The pickles had a flavor burst that explodes with a vinegar/salt deliciousness. And the batter so thin you could read through it. This would normally make the pickles greasy but somehow they kept that to a minimum and they were light instead of heavy. 
Then upon Victoria's urging I ordered the Risotto which is a new item on their menu. This dish was so wonderful that I am still thinking about it. Creamy, flavorful and worth writing a review about. If Victoria had not stepped in to clear my plate I might have been caught licking it clean with reckless abandonment. 
So despite my greeting at the door I am very glad I stayed and I would definitely come back here again."
1679364,Went there a couple of weeks ago for a birthday party. The happy hour menu has great food items. The bartender has a great sense of humor and customer service skills. When the wait staff didn't give the Birthday girl cake and ice cream he made sure it was done. I would go often just to hang at the bar with Rahiti (I thinks that's how to spell it) very unique name. It would have received 5 stars if the rest if the staff would have acknowledged the birthday girl.
2141518,"They have a very good tap selection; probably one of the best in Spokane, and the beer menu was sorted out by type which made it extremely easy to pick out a refreshing beverage. The bartender seemed really nice and helpful, and I liked that there is no fuss to get a sample before ordering your drink.

The patio seating looked like a really nice place for a bite to eat and pleasant conversation. It seems like the traffic on Grand may cause some noise, but it was 9pm on a Monday night so that was not an issue."
217804,"Just came back from LA and ate here first.  Still delicious and great to see they have expanded room to alleviate the long wait times.  Tried a few new things; the pork cheek is AWESOME as well as the tried and true pork hamburger.  

Hmm I had the oyster pancake which was weird...but was interesting to try.  Get the pork cheek, pork hamburger, lamb with green vegetable thing (my friends order...I have no idea what its called) and enjoy."
1136739,"come for the noodle.. but don't forget the get the wings.. they are delicious

their egg noodles with soup are excellent... i highly recommend getting one of their duck options (braised or roasted).. you can get the soup on the side if you don't want your roast duck to get soggy.. 

i'll be a regular here as they have free parking.. provide fast and friendly service.. and a damn good meal for a great price"
2162614,"It was such a comforting experience... creamy chowder on a chilly rainy spring day.

Pike Place Chowder really hit the spot. We just have this smile on our faces when we having their famous Clam Chowder and Manhattan Chowder for lunch.

These chowders are thick and every spoonful has clams inside...  If you prefer the more creamy texture, I definitely suggest their regular clam chowder.

Limited interior seating, so it is more like a eat and go place.

Writing this review makes me want to have a cup right now!!!"
813489,"Definitely has to be 2nd to the worst HR cafe I've visited.  1) the place is freakin small  2) service from the server was terrible  3) food was ewww  4) atmosphere, just didn't feel like HR."
2669670,"Attentive service, nice view of the Sound, but high priced for what you get. I had the crab cakes, got 2 but they were good. The chowder sampler as ok; I preferred the seafood chowder of the 3. Manny's Ale was recommended, and it was tasty. Go with that."
2641448,"Not impressed, to say the least. Every dish we ordered (foie gras, frites, chicken) was overwhelmed by excessive saltiness, which numbed my taste buds and rendered them unable to taste  whatever little flavor there was. Everything was over-salted, needlessly, crudely. Zinc is the taste I had in my mouth when leaving the restaurant.

The room was cold. The food assumed room temperature much sooner than we could finish it--and we were hungry, and the portions were meager. And speaking of the room, the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived. We had made reservations way ahead of time. Still, the maitre d' insisted the place would be filling any time now and seated us not by the window, as we asked, but in the corner between the busy walkway and staircase, with wait staff constantly shuffling just an arm's length away. This way, we got a not so appetizing view of people's feet at what must have been our chest level. Completely absurd layout, and absurdly strange behavior by the staff. 

The proximity to our neighbors, seated right next to us--again, in the otherwise empty and spooky-quiet restaurant--was uncomfortable. Both parties kept peeking into each other's plates. We couldn't help but eavesdrop on each other's conversations, which evetually turned to whisper. Aside from noises coming from the kitchen, the restaurant remained nearly empty during our stay. 

All that, plus exorbitant prices. Do I need to say we will not be going back?"
2195191,"Decided to check out Manhattan Drugs after looking at their menu online and deciding it might be a good place to grab a drink and maybe a nibble with a friend. Well, a drink turned to two and a nibble turned into a full dinner. 

The food here was delicious. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto with Prawns and I was in heaven. I have been to some places where the risotto is made and then the prawns are put on top - almost as a garnish. However, here, the prawns were cooked just right and sliced and mixed with the risotto to provide almost every bite with either tasty shrimp or delicious mushrooms (and sometimes both!). I also loved their freshly baked rolls that tasted like buttery biscuit heaven. I almost wished they would have some homemade preserves at the table because a little bit of strawberry or huckleberry may have pushed me over the edge. Still, just a great compliment to a filling meal.

As for the drinks, I had a Pimm's Cup which was outstanding. Then I asked for something sweet with a surprise from our fantastic server, Nicole. She had the bartender make up something wonderful which ended up being vodka and St. Germain liquor plus some other secrets. The service was terrific as our water was refilled constantly. I know I should try some of their steaks the next time I am there, but the damned risotto I can already feel calling me back. 

The interior is dark but cozy, with black and white wall projections that give it a fun, older establishment feel. 

Simply put, I was impressed. For a place that has only been open a few weeks, they seem to have everything going right. Definitely a place in my ""going often"" rotation."
1081513,"Ate here last night with friends, one of which is Puerto Rican. This location is much larger and nicer than the Ballard restaurant. Since our friend was the resident expert, we let her order for us and everything was delicious! We had an array of appetizers and each of us ordered a different entrÃ©e so we could sample more choices. Definitely a great dinner! I'll be back!"
162144,"Salty's is like the king of the block in this part of West Seattle. This place has outstanding food and has a commanding easterly view of the downtown Seattle skyline.

This is a great place to go to with your family, date or coworkers. I've never order a dish here that I didn't like. The happy hour at this place is fantastic! It starts at 3 pm and if you can grab a table outside (when weather permits), you will have some of the best views in town while enjoying top notch happy hour food at great prices.

If you plan on ordering from the regular menu, make sure that you first get acquainted with it because you can really pay for the view. 

Let me know if you want to go here for happy hour sometime. :)"
1116198,"Dome Burger is a hole-in-the-wall shop that'll work in a pinch. The fries are super salty and the burgers are standard fare, but the lone staffer is nice and the brews are cheap. WYSIWYG."
867430,"We were told about the Gobble a few months ago and stopped in to try it. That day was a cold rainy day and the Turkey Platter was such a welcome and tasty  meal it made me forget about the weather until I was done. We have been back a few more times and have not had a disappointing experiance. It is amazing all the items they make from Turkey, there is something on the menu for eveyone."
1002932,"The pizza is decent tasting but very skimpy on the toppings. We had it delivered to our hotel. Not only were they late by 10 minutes, but it was barely warm. If you want this quality of pizza, save your money and go to Dominos."
2158951,"Our second ""Serious"" spot on our food adventure, yup two in the same day. Delicious!! Don't forget the coconut pie...oh, my goodness!"
195698,"This place is awesome. I feel that it is a healthier version of regular Chinese hot pot! I tried the miso broth which I enjoyed. You get a plate of veggies with the meat/vegetarian selection of your choice.
Also, 1.50 for shaved ice, personal size. Great choice after a meal. So yummy!
If you don't know how to eat Shabu hot pot, the servers there are very willing to show you like me."
920543,"I'm not going back PRIMARILY because of the poor service, but the food made me a bit sick too.

First off, this was not a busy night. They didn't give some of our five-person group napkins, they forgot to provide water for one poor guy, and flat out forgot our drink orders (didn't even apologize). They ended up only filling waters once more throughout the night at the end when all glasses were empty from fighting off the spice of the food. We had to push two tables together to accommodate everybody, despite the wait staff just standing there watching, not offering to help in the slightest. Pretty much just careless service. My food, Chicken Wot, tasted yummy, except there was a small hunk of plastic in it. 

The food sent me to the bathroom within an hour, for another hour of stomach pain and, well, you know what. I'm typically good at handling spicy food and I managed to do fine living in India, so this has me suspecting that spice wasn't the culprit but rather undercooked chicken or something else unknown."
880622,"Our fave happy hour location. Joey is pretty consistent on service and great food options and quality. I am a huge fan of the seafood tacos. They are absolutely delicious... Shrimp, fish and crispy onions with very tasty guacamole and accompanying hot sauce. YUM.... Their drinks are fantastic, our favorites are the Sangria, Mojitos and the Blended peach billini is absolutely fantastic. Their salads, salmon and the lettuce wraps are also very, very yummy....The last time we were in they surprised us with amazing customer service. Our food was a bit delayed and they went WAY, WAY out of their way to make it right. Needless to say.... they won our hearts even more."
1784544,"The wife and I are on vacation for my birthday weekend in Seattle.  We are staying in Bellevue at the Hyatt House (which has been great).  We were looking for good Chinese food near the hotel and we hit the mark.

This is a nice, clean family run establishment.  They are extremely attentive and the owner was super nice.  He took the time to explain each dish we had questions about.   I can say the General Tsoa's chicken is deliciousness.  If you are in the mood for something different, try the Egg Foo Yung.  It was awesome.  I recommend this place, we were happy we chose the Wok instead of a strip mall joint."
770238,"Great prices! Super yummy food. I ordered the shrimp spring rolls to share with a friend and we each got a Vietnamese sandwich, for less than $8 for each of us! The service was prompt as well. They have a couple of tables outside which are nice when it's sunny. Beware the jalapeÃ±o in your sandwich if, like me, it will set your mouth on fire!"
1915151,We attended a wedding here. They had breakfast for dinner. It was awesome and delicious! The space has great decor. Looking forward to trying again on a regular day.
946370,"This place is an absolute sham!

Anthony's poses as something it is not. Everything was horrendous!

Food:
Started with the crab cakes, and had them sent back. The taste was off (not good/fresh product) and it was cold. Ladies and gentlemen, I NEVER SEND FOOD BACK, BUT I HAD TO HERE! Completely turned off at this point, I ordered a salad. The leaves were rotten and wilted. I hate to sound so picky but this was just miss after miss.

Service:
Unaccommodating. Waiter was not helping or suggesting anything to make my experience pleasant. 

Overpriced, underrated and outdated. Would be having a better time going to Long John Silver (sarcasm)."

1313293,"I found this amazing little place across from my orthodontist's office.  It serves creole food with an atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in New Orleans without the humidity.  The owners are there serving their loyal patrons and it is just a lovely experience.  This is great for lunch, dinner, and I am told that weekend brunch is not to be missed; I can believe that."
691575,"Dark, candlelit, and classy.

Reservations are probably needed but we made them on open table about 2 hours beforehand.

The wait for our food was a little too long (nearing 50 minutes) and I felt like other tables were being served before us but it was worth the wait.

I had the house-made cavatelli and it was amazing. The mushrooms were slightly crunchy and thin. It makes me want to cook with mushrooms more. The pasta was perfect. The sauce wasn't too creamy.

I'm looking forward to the happy hour here!"
1884477,One word AMAZING!!!!! Ive been going here since it first opened! My dad did all the kitchen wirk for them. Bean dip is amazing! Idk why anyone would  go anywhere else for mexican food!
2604181,"Sit at the sushi bar - you will be happy that you did. 
We went for lunch last week and had an amazing experience! My husband came to Seattle for a conference so I was looking for a place close to the LINK  and was so glad we found this place and Columbia City for that matter. I wish I knew our chef's name because he deserves a shout out! We had such a good time watching him and eating his amazing creations that we were there for an hour and half and didn't even realize it.
The food was fresh and really well priced for the quality (around $12 a roll). My husband dared the chef to make a spicy roll and man oh man did the chef deliver! Everything we had was so fresh and well seasoned that we didn't touch a drop of soy or wasabi.
Thank you Wabi Sabi for a great Sushi experience!"
924253,"My husband has lived in Belltown for three years (two years for me) and Bang Bang is by far our favorite place to grab a meal in the whole neighborhood. We feel very welcome there and the sisters who run the cafe are very sweet women.

I bring all my relatives and friends from out of town to Bang Bang and they all agree that the food is very delicious, filling, and cheap!

I often get their coffee, which is a delicious secret blend they did themselves, and it always tastes amazing. They're quick to put out new batches. I've also had their chai latte and their caramel latte. They do a great job frothing the milk and the presentation of the foamy top is amazing!

For food, I've had their vegan mac 'n cheese, which is amazingly savory. A full bowl of it will leave you stuffed! I've also had their Basic breakfast burrito (egg, cheddar, and potatoes) and their Egg 'n Cheddar breakfast bagel. The former is great if you're really hungry--it's a big burrito!--and the latter is great if you love chewy, perfectly toasted and buttery bagels. The potato chunks in the Basic burrito are always freshly chopped (skin-on), fluffy, and lightly seasoned. The eggs in the burritos and bagels are always piping hot, well-cooked, and have the *perfect* texture.

If you're looking for a cafe with delicious food, eye-opening and amazing coffee, and a very local feel, you have to become a regular at Bang Bang Cafe!"
958379,"I had returned after an inferior experience two weeks ago, and was very impressed. After Christmas shopping all afternoon, I was looking forward to a relaxing early dinner, and found exactly what I was hoping for. 
Started with an appetizer of tuna tataki and it was phenomenal! Seared tuna, excellent spices and just the ideal amount of seaweed. For my entree, I ordered the spicy fish and was very content with it. 
Definitely will return."
969484,Very nice signature cocktails.  That should about sum it up.
2146312,"Small portions and high prices - so why 4 stars??

For one, said combination is not exactly uncommon nowadays, especially in Seattle.  It's become less about feeling overly full from a meal, and more about eating high quality stuff, and I won't complain about this trend.  Anyone can hop on over to the Old Country Buffet if they're looking to do the former.

Indeed, Aragona steps up its food to the high quality mark by serving unique, fresh ingredients that are pretty well presented.  Our meals were graced with ingredients like tripe, octopus, squab, shrimp, and tender beef (not all in one; rather, separate dishes).  The chefs presented the ingredients in a pretty congruent fashion, so you could tell they took a lot of care in plating.  The taste was nothing short of outstanding.  The arroz with squab was my favorite dish.  The rice was well balanced in texture, having a firmer bite to it.  The squab was cooked rare, so the flesh was still red and tender.

The cocktails were ok, although one major reason I looked forward to Aragona was because David from Il Bistro supposedly moved over here.  It was sad to see that he no longer works here.  I didn't feel motivated to drink much after hearing of his departure, so I ordered a couple Fidencio Sin Humo mescals, neat.  Not bad stuff, but I didn't end up venturing into cocktail territory.

The customer service is a perfect way to close, as I try to save the best for last.  The wait staff was attentive, charming, and accommodated whatever we needed.  Several people actually took care of us, so we got plenty of attention.  Drinks refilled on time, dirty dishes taken away quickly, and food served as it was done in the kitchen.  They, for a second, made us forget how much we'd end up spending on the food and drink at the end of the night.

So, if you want to impress your date by showing how much money you can blow away at once, at least do it at a place where you get your money's worth.  In other words, pay a visit to Aragona."
819453,"I have to base this review on exactly the star description, I've experienced better. 

I ordered my usual Beef Pad Se Ewe and Chicken Panang Curry both with 2 stars. I was STARVING and was really looking forward to this take out meal. The staff who rang me up was very friendly and my food was ready to go. I thought that they were a little on the pricy side though, not by much, usually I can get the same dish for under $10 and this place was a little over...

We I got home I noticed that the curry was packed with chicken which I was pleasantly surprised by since usually it is a lot of sauce and you have to dig out the chicken. Same with the Pad se ewe, lots of meat. So I was excited. Upon tasting it though I thought they both lacked flavor and spice! It wasn't spicy at ALL. I do 2 stars to be conservative and I am a big spice wuss. 

The beef I thought was terrible quality and the chicken on the other hand was good. But all in all it was just so bland I was disappointed. So yes I have experienced better Thai food before than this place. 

I would not recommend this thai place there are plenty of other thai restaurant in Kirkland that are just the same price. I think this place had everything going for it to be a great restaurant."
2155687,"Overpriced but probably the best (and only) quality place to eat out in Lake Stevens. I still find it hard to spend $60 for 2 people to have dinner (no desserts) in a small town like Lake Stevens, but the food is good and their service is also good. After trying most of their menu, I would recommend sticking with their pizza and salad selection."
677876,"I don't know how I've missed this place in Edmonds. I walk by here all the time and never noticed this place.

I stopped by here for lunch with the fam...mostly because it is on the Passport card and we get a discount. The place was really busy for a week day lunch (why isn't everyone working??) but there were a few spots open. We were waiting for my Dad, and they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there. Even though I understand this policy, for some reason, it always annoys me.

Anyway, we were eventually seated and they had a pretty decent selection for lunch of salads, sandwiches, etc. I opted for a chop chop salad with turkey, dried cranberries, crumbled bacon and apples with a horseradish apple dressing. The salad was just okay. The horseradish made it a little spicy but the main thing for me was that it hardly had any meat on it. The turkey was really minimal which was disappointing. The salad wasn't bad...just nothing really stood out to me.

I tasted the tomato bisque soup, too which is supposed to be some of the best. While the texture was good, it was a little bland to me. Overall, just okay.

The service, however, was very friendly and not overly annoying. Cute little place in Edmonds but I like The Loft better."
826747,I can honestly say this was my first experience with Thai food. I dont think I can give an accurate description of the quality given I dont have much to base my judgement on but I can say that I enjoyed the taste. I can also say the serving sizes were adequate as I left here very full. I was satisfied with my choice and would recommend this place if you were craving Thai food in the area.
903112,"I adore this place! The setting is quaint and has a friendly staff. I've been going here since I started college at UW in 2007 and haven't stopped going since. The service and quality of service has been consistent as long as I've been by. 

I normally order the pupusa's: beans with cheese, zuccini-cheese-jalapeno, and pork with cheese. If you don't know what to order, ask the staff. They'll be more than willing to help you find a good fit, I've also had their tacos and burritos; which are great but I feel as if their pupupsa's are a speciality here."
580916,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

Tuna in a Box? Whoever thought of that, is a GENIUS.

I have had my share of sushi, nigiri, rolls... sashimi whatever you want to call it.

Tuna in a Box? What! It is so simple yet flavors bursted in my mouth! It's like hitting your head and seeing stars, but eating delicious goodness and tasting fireworks!

I had to write this review ASAP after I got home (:

Let me slow down a bit, this was my first time here. I apparently had this place bookmarked but never really looked into it.

It was 10 PM and I made sure to call and see if they were still open. Sometimes Yelp hours are not up to date.

The person on the phone kindly said their last call to order is 10, 10:30 ish. I know how it feels to have the late crawlers come in RIGHT before... a restaurant starts closing. One of my pet peeves as a waitress.

But I just had to satisfy my random night sushi cravings. NO where else was open. Thankfully, this place was! At least I have one bookmark crossed off my list (:

My friend and I also ordered the yellow tail roll and albacore tuna nigiri.

I have to say, I thought the yellow tail roll would be wrapped with seaweed on the inside... that's how it is done usually but that's alright. I am not too big a fan on yellow tail. However, I LOVED the albacore tuna nigiri! Who knew nigiri fish could be so soft? The albacore just melted in my mouth! LOVE LOVE LOVED it. Seriously.

Tonight was one of the highlight experiences to pour out in my yelp reviews. I only get that once in awhile. 

The nice sushi chef.... accidently made the yellow tail roll into yellow tail nigiri.

At first, he took it back and the guy next to him just said to give it to us. So we got accidently made complimentary yellow tail nigiri! Which I thought of it as a sign from God with the intention of making this review even better! The yellow tail nigiri was alright... my friend enjoyed it more than I did but I reallly loved the albacore... if I did not emphasize enough on it (:

I WILL BE BACK!!~ 

By the way, love the interior! Looks so cute and romantic! Perfect for a date."
854315,"We celebrated our first anniversary here. I have never been to the restaurant before, and the moment we walked in, every staff member greeted us warmly and genuinely. Even the bus boy welcomed us and gave us food recommendations!

Our server was Justyne (I think that's how she spells it) and she was amazing. The perfect balance of accommodating while giving us our space to leisurely enjoy the four or five courses we ended up choosing. And, she paired our courses impeccably with wine that we had asked her to choose for us. Talk about being taken care of!

Our food was simply divine. My husband loved the house made tots, and I was in heaven with the beet and pistachio-pesto salad. My scallops were cooked perfectly, and my husband's duck was heavenly. Honestly, every dish we had the night was memorable, cooked perfectly, and timed accordingly. 

Lastly, the view was the cherry on top. It was beautiful, and made us feel that we were some place really special. 

I am a Seattle resident, and do not find myself on the Eastside by choice (especially for dinners and special occasions) but I have already probably told at least 20 people how amazing our dinner was and how it was a meal to remember- which is exactly what we wanted for our first anniversary!

Thanks again Bin on the Lake"
791699,"My wife had been here a week before and raved about it and wanted to take me. I agreed and had a good experience. The food was alright, but not amazing.

We had the bread with harissa butter and chickpeas for an appetizer. Both were really good. Flavor on the chickpeas was really good.

My wife had the paella and I had the clams and mussels with pork. Would have been nice to have some vegetables in with them for a flavor/color/texture contrast to the pork and shellfish. The pork was super tender and the clams were good. The mussels didn't have much flavor. Not great, but not bad by any means. I did appreciate that they roasted off the potatoes before adding them to the dish. It added to flavor and helped them keep their texture.

The seafood in my wife's paella was a little overcooked and it came out oily. I know, it's paella, the seafood should be cooked with the rice, but it should be added at the end so it doesn't come out dry.

The cheesecake came with a balsamic drizzle. It was too much for the delicate flavor of the cheesecake. It was good, but balsamic is getting to be played out being used for everything now.

Our waiter, who had been there for only about 4 months, was fantastic. Great service! Perfect blend of friendly and accommodating and professional."
30436,"I love this place, 5 starts all the way. Everything we had was so freaking good, and definitely better than any Vietnamese restaurant in the Bay Area (well except the super upscale Vietnamese Fusion restaurants). My son had the beef stew soup minus the blood cube and he loved the tasty broth. My boyfriend who is typically not a fan of Vietnamese food (thank goodness this was right off the freeway which is why he gave us the green light to come here) had the Com Dac Biet. He loved it so much that he said as long as they have Com Dac Biet as good as this place, then he wouldn't mind going to Vietnamese restaurants more often. I had the Bun Dac Biet, and hands down it's the best vermicelli bowl I've ever had. It has an egg roll, pork and chicken with an extra touch of  crispy onions on the top which I really liked. 

I wish they had this in the Bay Area as this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to! I can't wait to go back."
862457,"My favorite place to on Alki, particularly fun to take guests, as the location/views are amazing.  This has become our favorite neighborhood place - pizza and lamb shank are especially delicious."
1897560,"Great Barbecue.  I showed up as I had found this on yelp as being close to my hotel.  Though not many folks were in on a Tuesday evening, it was a decent crowd.    I sat down next to the bar and was greeted by a friendly bartender who introduced himself.  

It turned out that I was also sitting next to the owner Rob who was a friendly person to chat with.  He mentioned the restaurant had only been opened for a few months and that he owned a separate barbecue place a little farther north than this one.  

I had read that the platters were large so decided to order a brisket sandwich which was quite good.  Rob explained that his favorite sauce was the ""extra spicy"" and it was quite good, though all of them were good.

It was a pleasure chatting with Rob, and consuming his Brisket Sandwich.  Well done, I'll be back."
265269,"I came here for a late night dinner with some friends and man oh man was it good. I only had a salad when I came here, but by far one of the best salads ever! I had the Marinated Rabbit Salad with Fried egg and I cannot emphasize enough ""WHAT THE HELL!"" Where have you been all my life?!

This egg is amazing and the salad is sooooo flavorful. Place was unique and very hipster, which sort of reminded me of places in Chicago. Def. a must go if you are trying to find something unique and delicious."
814309,We LOVE El Gaucho!  On Sundays we love sitting in the bar area and listening to the beautiful piano music.  I always enjoy vodka and their homemade blueberry syrup.  Crab cakes are really tasty.  You won't get better service at any other establishment.
1048609,"I was really excited about this place and I was so sad it wasn't what I was expecting. The pizza I got was the wild child and it wasn't good at all. I asked for it well done and they didn't make it that way. I took one bite and knew it was not for me. It was taken off the table and bill.
The service was friendly and their Onion Rings are VERY good. Their drinks are HUGE but over priced. I also didn't like I had to get a ""Back Stage Pass"" to get the Happy Hour special but it didn't say that on the menu. It was only after I said something when I looked at the check. That for me was taking their ""Theme"" too far."
218313,"I have a theory, I think Seattle or the Puget Sound in general is cursed and doomed to have bad Chinese food forever.  Hear me out.

I call it the Shitty Chinese Food Industrial Complex or SCFIC for short.  It is in essence; the opposite of the military industrial complex, it's an arms race of a combination of who can make crappier Chinese food, charge more for it and/or in the least cleanliness environment possible.  Whereas the MIC is an ever growing beast that eats up spending and capital at the expense of our people and resources, the SCFIC is an ever lazier bum that tries to do things shittier and shittier and hoping to get away with it.

I came to this conclusion the last time I ate at DTF a month or so ago.  When they first opened, I have to say I really enjoyed the food.  Even through it is extremely overpriced, but hey what other options do you have for dumplings?  Each time I went back however, things have gotten just a little bit worse, maybe not really noticeable each time but if you were to compare the 1st two months with the state of things now, it is definitely noticeably worse.

Let's break it down.  To have any good ""food, service, cleanliness"" Chinese restaurant you need first and foremost a chef that cares, DTF had that in the beginning.  However, once the local staff is trained, the chefs and waitresses are flown back to Taiwan.  As time goes by, the quality slowly slips as there is no one with that level of skill to uphold the standard.  As the initially trained staff moves on, the knowledge, skill and technique training is highly unlikely to transfer successfully as well.  Leaving us with worse and worse food.  Your typical Bellevue waitress girl will not be able to tell you the difference between good and bad dumplings, nor should you expect her to.  This is no fault to the restaurant owners, I am sure they prefer things to be better but unless the restaurant owner is also the chef, it is impossible to uphold the high standards over time.  (Kukai Ramen will play out the same way, I guarantee it.)

The second thing you need is a population that is established and attuned to what is good and what is bad Chinese food, we do not have this at all.  If a crappy Chinese restaurant opened in Richmond, BC, it would quickly go out of business.  Not the case down here.

Lastly, and this is linked to the first and second point, it is that the ones that do own the restaurant are not doing it out of love of cooking, it is simply looked at as a business.  If you are not passionate about something, it will turn out crappy, that's just how it goes.  We have an absolute abundance of crappy Chinese restaurants for this reason which feeds directly into the second point, if people are willing to just pay for cheap crappy Chinese food, Seattle will never ascend to the greatness of other NA cities.  A feedback loop is now created and those who even want to create greatness in Chinese food for Seattle find themselves in it, forcing success to be less and less likely (why buy/pay more for better quality products when you can just buy orange chicken from panda express).  The few good restaurants are truly few and far between.

Just a thought."
787984,"I tried John Howie for the first time recently over lunch and was not impressed.  The service and atmosphere were fine, but if you have ""steak restaurant"" in your name and can't make a decent steak to order, you don't get more than 2 stars in my book.  I ordered steak medium rare and what I received was a bit more than medium; chewy and overcooked.  I can spend half as much to buy a better cut of meat at Safeway and grill it myself to a perfect medium rare, so I probably won't bother going back to JH."
2166222,"Review based on pre-gaming before Mariner's games. Came once to the Pyramid beer garden four years ago, and then again recently and was happy both times. Good natured crowd and the food shack makes decent fair for a lot less than ballpark prices. If you can squeeze in there is ladderball and cornhole to play as well. Wish other teams had this sort of setup so close the the ballpark."
126681,"This place was pretty good.  I got the pulled pork w/baked beans and fried mac and cheese.  The meat was good but a little over cooked.  The cornbread was a bit airy and not very moist.  The beans were great.  The fried mac was pretty tasty but a little on the salty side.

They offer 4 types of bbq sauce:  Regular (Kentucky), Smokey (Memphis), Spicy (Habenero), and Vinegar based (Carolina).  They also have a mustard.  All of the sauces seemed to be pretty good but the habenero didn't seem to carry much bbq flavor.

If you're in the neighborhood, this place was overall pretty tasty but maybe not up to some people's standards."
1896919,"This place is kinda meh. The food is ok, although kind of expensive for what you get. The service is meh. Our food is always kind of lukewarm like it's been sitting in the window too long. The coffee is bleh. Cute atmosphere, but I prefer Hi-los."
1438079,"I don't understand the great reviews, to be honest. I wanted to adore this place - local, lovely inside, pizza and pasta, beer... sounds awesome! My partner and I have had dinner there 3 times, as we kept hoping that we just hit them on a bad night but now we're giving up.

The service is SLOW. Friendly but so slow, and it isn't just because the food seems to take forever to cook. After being there for over an hour, I never even got a refill on iced tea or water. The flies kept us company though... 

The food wasn't worth the wait. My partner had a mediocre pizza, and I had a baked pasta dish that was amazingly bland (thank goodness there was salt on the table.) The caesar salad was average. All of the dishes we've gotten in the past were similar, pretty but bland. 

Visually it looks great for date night, but it's also ""family friendly"" and usually filled with shrieking children. Kind of killed date night for us.

So... we won't be back. If it's really just coincidence and we're going there on off days, well... we must have the worst timing ever and it isn't worth trying to overcome it."
993756,"Our favorite Vancouver restaurant.  Started with rustic bread and olive oil.  Cheap and really good.  Then smoked salmon and trout fettuccine and wife had pork chops and both were fantastic.  Dessert was like a chocolate decadence with ice cream which is hard to go wrong.  With two glasses of house wine, came to about $80.  Service was good.  They were packed and our waiter was running."

What makes a movie great!
1. No crying babies!

What makes a movie even better
1. Bar Food!
2. Beer!

Service is awesome and the reason I say that is because you get what you give, I have been here more times than I am willing to admit and NOT once have I had a bad experience!

I have however seen a few people get the hammer dropped on them, mostly when customers say things like ""Well at i-pic you get a blanket"" and here someone say ""then go there"" and I would tend to agree!

863343,"Toulouse Petit though! Lol. I came here with my family for happy hour as soon as we landed in Seattle because my uncle recommended it! We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and a couple of drinks! 

The toulouse beef sliders were pretty good! But really, the fries and the sauce, OMG sooo good. Lol. The manila clams was definitely one of my favorites. They were fresh and definitely well sauced all up in that goodness. Ahhh I want some mooore! The crab and fried green tomatoes was my other favorite! It's soooo good, I can't even explain the goodness! I can only recommend you to try these bad boys! Lol. The fried catfish and fried chicken were also pretty good! Honestly, I don't really have anything negative to say about anything! 

This place was amazeballs. The toulouse hurricane and the madame toulouse drinks were really tasty too! They were fruity but there was definitely alcohol in those bad boyz! Hahaha! I think the only downfall to this place is the price. Even during happy hour it's a little pricey, but hey, YOLO right?"
1374095,"So impressed overall with Emory's!  After reading so many ""meh."" reviews it was never really a place that I considered going...until after meeting a friend there for lunch over the weekend.  First off, the views outside and breeze is lovely.  Staff is super attentive and accommodating.  I had a request to change tables, they adjusted the umbrella proactively and when we had a drink tumble within minutes there was another one there.  

Happy hour is DAILY!  Thank you!  Great specials and savings on apps and drinks.  

Bloody Mary was delicious and spicy and pepped me up for sure!

Shared a prosciutto, pear and brie pizza and I'm so glad we did - it was rich and full of so many great things!  Love a well executed thin crust packed with my favorite ingredients! Well done!

I can't wait to introduce my lover to this place.                     Show owner comment »"
981832,"As noted in other reviews, service is the main issue. When we arrived, the woman standing at the front essentially hid her face from us, stared at the computer for a couple of minutes, then walked away without saying a word. Then another woman walked in from outside and asked how may were in our party. Our waiter made himself very scarce, and our food took a lo-o-ong time. And it was not a very busy time. The food was alright, but nothing I couldn't pull off at home, and I'm not that great in the kitchen."
1173035,"I want to give a balanced review, because if a friend asked me for my honest opinion of Sage's Brunch House, I'd say that I recommend it, but with certain caveats.

The food here is good.  It is also expensive.  (You will easily spend about $30 for two entrees and a coffee.)  So you could look at it as a special treat brunch--as long as you're ok with your special treat being super casual.

Also, I don't know which days Sage herself usually works, but try not to go on a day that she's manning the stove, especially if she's decided to ""babysit"" her son at the counter that day.  I know that sounds horrible--and I do not know her personally--but when I was a customer there and she was working it ruined my experience (and oddly, the food wasn't quite as good that day either).  The problems were that she was bossing around the staff in a loud and unnecessary manner, and that she was having very loud and long arguments with her spoiled tween son.  Since the kitchen area is basically part of the dining area, you can't help but hear every word and it was uncomfortable, inappropriate, and made for a bad experience to listen to everything she was dishing out.  I guess I know now why most restaurants have their kitchen space separated.

So far we've generally liked the food, which manages to be good-sized portions that leave you nicely satisfied but not uncomfortably stuffed.  Everything my husband and I have had was made vegetarian for us, and was very good.  The only mistake that happened was when they assured me there wouldn't be mushrooms in my dish and there were mushrooms (I'm allergic).  The migas are kind of like tacos with lots of yummy veggies to put inside.  They will fill you up without weighing you down and are delicious.  The galactic scramble has eggs with a good mix of seasonings and veggies, and is topped with a sauce that is divine--and this dish comes with good bread and jam (eat the potato pancake along with the flavorful scramble, it's quite plain on its own).  The Heuvos Rancheros was delicious, just the right combination of flavors of runny egg yolk, beans, corn tortilla, sauce...  The ""samosa"" scramble is good but doesn't taste at all like a samosa, so don't order it with that in mind (it's another cool Sage's creation with tons of interesting ingredients, it's just not Indian flavored.)  

Their coffee is very good too, though be very specific when ordering as we have had a mix-up in that department (there was more than one type of coffee with the same name).  The only item so far that I would not recommend, is their blackberry drink.  On the menu is says it's crushed blackberries with mint and instead it was blackberry syrup with no mint--so sweet and artificial tasting I couldn't drink it, though my husband with the big sweet tooth didn't mind it.

It does rain much of the year here, so I wish they'd get more awnings for the waiting area outside.  You almost always have to come prepared to wait outside for a while and it's not fun to do that while being rained on.  In our experience the waitstaff has always been friendly and professional (if barely dressed--super casual, entire bra showing is not unusual).  So basically, go for the food if you can afford it and are relaxed about your surroundings."
1041043,"When my friend recommended that we check this Persian/Lebanese restaurant out, I was excited.  You see, I grew up across the street to Persian neighbors, and they knew how to do it good! Because of them, I stick my nose up to imitation Persian food!  Well, this place more... fusion... And to be honest, I'm not a huge fusion person.  Why can't we just keep it OG around here... I digress...

We about 7 small plates, and all of the dishes were okay.  Was it good? Sure.. however, I felt like the creativity factor was lacking.  My take on it is, if you're going to do fusion, then give me something crazy that will make my mind and taste buds think! Otherwise, give me OG :)"
1087387,"I so wanted to give this place 5-Stars but it wouldn't be fair. The only negative thing (let me get this out of the way) was the service; fast but not very knowledgeable. Our server was not familiar with the beer selection, nor could he inform me vegan friend of appropriate dishes - I don't think he knew anything about the dishes other than what was printed on the menu.

Now the positive. I think everything on the menu is good. They have several dished featuring duck (fan) and they menu is ample without being overwhelming. They have congee (porridge/soup, not Japanese script) - and they have several varieties! The Sriracha sauce is flowing in this place and I really like the feel of the layout. It's basically under the Labor Union Temple, and you walk down into a basemented area - the decorations are perfect. This place is unassuming. 

The best? This place has Delirium Tremens on tap - that's just amazing. Even though anyone who likes Delirium knows that the tap ruins it - it's still amazing.

I can't say if this place is better, or worse, than the original in the ID, but I am now a regular."
1746174,"I know what to expect at these types of restaurants and I'm usually never disappointed. This visit was no exception. Even though there were a lot of patrons already in the dining room, we were seated immediately and served very quickly. My husband had the carne asada and I ventured out from what I always get at Mexican restaurants (chicken enchilada with rice and beans) and tried the Pollo Mazatlan. I was very happy that I ordered that dish; it was delicious! We were both very satisfied with our meals. Mine came with salad and rancho beans. If I ordered it again, I would just ask for less cheese, which is probably just a personal preference."
1334291,"Good happy hour and the outdoor seating is a huge plus. Other than that, nothing stands out too much about Linda's. Definitely worth stopping in though :)"
906234,"The food is just awful! Chow mein tastes like top ramen, meat dishes are tough and weird.  Over priced for the takeout we picked up and only ate 3 bites of!  So disappointing."
1204214,"Not sure where the other reviewers get anything above a 1 maybe 2 star for this place.  I ordered the coconut shrimp and drunken noodles.  The shrimp were butterflied and super thin, the breading was panko with no coconut, much less a coconut flavor.  They were over cooked, so they were a little tough.  The drunken noodles were bland, very little flavor, and the noodles were mushy.  Not much more I can say.  Not a place I can recommend."
1942632,"We were visiting Seattle on vacation and checked out the zagat review for steelhead which was great!

Well it deserves all 5 stars!

Great service, friendly wait staff! And the food was to die for! The salmon special on polenta was melting in my mouth it was so amazing! 

I would go here all the time if I lived here!"
234251,"If I could give them less than 1 star I would!! This place is super fancy and pricy so I accepted the food to be out of this world, and what can I say, it was out of a third world country! 
I went there with friends who were visiting from LA for a jewelry show and none of us can say a single good word about this place.A huge disappointment. 
I'm not trying to sound mean and I like to give good reviews but this one doesn't deserve it. We paid so much for nothing, we didn't even want to try their deserts!
On top of the bad food, the place was extremely loud we could barely hear each other, the service was so so and it took them forever to bring our food out. 
Im sorry Tulio Restaurant, but I'm not a fan."
1003236,This is a very good little gyro sandwich shop and the pizza is good.  I have not tried there entrees.  My wife really loves the chicken Slovaki Skewers. And my kids love there pizza.
784130,"Hands down the best breakfast/brunch/lunch place I ever been to in Seattle area. Since there are so many reviews already, I will save some of your time and keep this one short. 

Food: Amazing. Great variety of food and has a great breakfast happy hour M-F 9-11am. I think all of the breakfast dishes are $6 (some $7?) Portion is great and the the dishes are so rich in flavor. Not too spicy, salty, sweet... Just perfect. Service can be little slow BUT considering the number of people dining there, it's expected. 

Ambiance: On a nice sunny day, make sure you try to seat next to the windows. My friend and I were lucky to be seated next to the windows on a sunny Saturday and it was perfect. Other than seemingly-out-of-place disco ball nearby the bar area, decor was good. Not romantic or anything but had some class to it.

Price: It's little pricy. If you are here for breakfast happy hour or lunch prix menu, you won't have to spend too much to enjoy top-quality Creol/French cuisine. 

Location/Parking: Parking can be a hassle but it wasn't too bad. My friend and I were able to secure a parking spot within couple minutes of walking distance. It's not too far from Key Arena and the Space Needle so if you feel heavy after a huge breakfast/brunch/lunch, you can take a short stroll there. 

We will definitely visit Toulouse Petit again."
282122,"Truly as wonderful as most of the reviews express.  I particularly enjoyed the cocktails (perfectly balanced Sidecar) and the Scotch egg.  My beef brisket sandwich was good.  Next time I'll get the burger because my dining companion kindly offered me a bite and I had to resist the urge to tell him I wasn't giving it back.  Hand cut steak fries, too.  I can't wait to return and try more of the menu!"
919558,I gonna say they got the best steak in the place. The meat is really fresh I can taste it done in medium raw .
958114,"Everything on happy hour menu. Salmon bruschetta. Olive, tomato jam, goat cheese bruschetta. Pork skewer. Flank steak. Steamers. Fries with aioli. Olives and bread. Squid skewer. 2 cocktails. $58.
Sit in the back at the counter overlooking the kitchen. All of the chefs will speak to you, interact, and answer any questions.

I personally loved the pork skewers, but I think that is because my wife doesn't eat pork, so I get it all to myself. Fork tender and melted in my mouth. The pouring rain that showered the outdoors had everyone running inside. As soon as everyone ran inside it was like they all wanted to order food at ONCE. Kitchen was super fun to watch. The waiter tried not to sit anyone near us and we could spread all of our food out.

I loved this place because I watch WAY too much Food Network and love love being able to see all of those shows up close and personal. Hearing, ""YES CHEF!"" never gets old."
960076,"Did lunch here today and had a great meal. The short rib appetizers were really really good; not kidding. Also ordered one of my favorite Chinese dishes, broccoli beef, and my buddy said it was the best he has ever had. 

It is probably over priced for Chinese food but delivers a nice atmosphere."
2154415,"American-Japanese sushi, but good!"
1121293,"Recently moved from Las Vegas and I was looking for some good authentic mexican tacos. Well, I found my home away from home, well even better than anything Vegas had! There tacos are made fresh and their salsas are quality. I will be coming back. I'm from Los Angeles (east LA, Whittier area) and these are just as good!"
189329,"Poutine is pretty tasty (ask for extra curds) and their crab cake poboy is pretty tasty with great crusty bread.  Drinks are average.  Local spot where you can be yourself.  Let the good times roll, indeed."
246041,"So Neil W and I decided to get dinner here Wednesday night.  The short version of the this review is that dinner here was awesome!!  Keep reading for the longer version.  :)

Well Neil and I arrived at Revel around at 6:00.  It was packed.  We were told that it would take about 30-40 minutes get a table.  So we wandered into the small bar that is attached to the restaurant, Quoin.  We order some drinks and talked.  Eventually the hostess came in and called for us.

Once we were seated I took a closer look at the restaurant.  It was still packed.  The restaurant definitely has a nice modern feel to it.  The walls were white with paintings of celebrities on them.  My favorite was a picture of Macho Man Randy Savage.  There was little exposed wood in the restaurant, with the exception being our tables.  I think the best seat in the house was the counter facing the kitchen.  I love watched chefs work.

The menu wasn't very big, but I usually think that is a good sign.  Neil and I ordered the pork belly pancakes, dumplings, and the Manila Clam hot pot.  The pork belly pancakes came out first.  They obviously had pork belly on them, but in addition it also had kimchi and bean sprouts on it.  And oh my gosh that combination was very very good.  I could have eaten a couple plates of that alone.  The pancake had hints of kimchi, so that it didn't overwhelm all the other toppings on it.  Next came the dumplings.  The dumplings that we ordered were stuffed with short ribs, shallots, and scallions.   They were wrapped in a red flour shell.  The dumplings were moist and delicious.  Last was the manila clam hot pot.  It was pretty big, good thing we were sharing.  It had medium sized clams in it that were very tasty.  The broth that it was cooked in was a little spicy, but still light and tasty.  The hot pot also had slices of a rice flour noodle, white carrot, bok choy, and some small dumplings.  I think the dumplings had chorizo as a stuffing.  They were wonderfully delicious.  Everything about this meal worked to where I felt full, but not overstuffed.  

My only criticism of Revel is if they are gonna use chopsticks then they need to use wood ones.  They gave us these plastic chopsticks.  Since there is no grip to them food kept slipping and falling back on the plates.  Other than that Revel is a great place to go and get a meal.

If your in the Fremont neighborhood you definitely have to stop by Revel.  It was a great meal with a great atmosphere. The service we received was fantastic.  The staff was really friendly and they checked in to make sure the food was to our satisfaction.  I would definitely go back!!!"
822346,"This place is a rare find !  The salads are beautiful ! We had the linguini chicken with artichokes and the Lasagne Mama Mia ! Totally Yummy !  We LOVED the Chocolate Carmel Cake ! The owner, Daniella, is so friendly and sweet......Verona's gets a big A+ !"
1124582,"This is Friday evening, the prime time for dinner. After seeing 4- star yelp review, we went here for dinner. There was no one customer in the restaurant. Although we were surprised, we ordered the food anyway, Pad Thai, and curry seafood. The price is not really cheap. For instance, the hot and sour Thai shrimp soup, we typically see price around $7-8 in other decent Thai restaurant, here it charged more than $10. Pad Thai is pathetic looking, with eggs, a few bean sprouts, cabbage, and tofu ( we chose tofu). The peanuts are barely visible. The rice noodle is soft and soggy. The seafood curry cost almost $15, but it is small portion, and hardly tasted the creamy coconut  we have tasted in other Thai restaurant. A bowl of white rice comes with it, but they charged us $3 for the rice. In the end, we paid almost $35 for only one dish of Pad Thai and one dish of curry seafood, very expensive but with lousy quality. Guess what? Now we understand why at 7 pm Friday evening, there are no other customers other than us. And we surely will never return."
1061241,"My boyfriend and I go here sometimes. I always get the coconut soup. It is all I want and it is delicious. Last time we went we got some kind of other red...er type soup. It wasn't what we were expecting and so I traded my delicious curry to eat that soup which at the time was okay because I was full of my own delicious soup. The curry and coconut soup are fantastic I can say for certain....the teas are nice and the place is always pretty empty when we go which is around two hours before close on weekdays. Overall, I like the family that runs this place, the food is pretty tasty."
934781,HORRIBLE service. They get lots of traffic being in the mall. Location and name recognition have got to be the only reasons this place stays as busy as it does.
864531,Always good.  Never had a bad meal.  We ate here before going to the Fifth Avenue and they got us out in plenty of time.  I like that you can eat at any price range you want depending on what you order.  A great standby!
1480560,"First time here and the food was great. I had the Santa Fe Burrito and hubby had the Chimichanga. Huge portions, too. Really good margaritas, too.
Give it a try, especially if you have the 8$ coupon."
967738,"Pretty good food, Americanized sushi, good spicy mayo, but horrible service every time. All the servers have to do is bring drinks and the occasional special request, but they are slow and often act as if that little bit of work is too much for them.  Drinks often stay empty, so don't bother getting a soda!"
863290,"My favorite restaurant in Seattle! Best breakfast and happy hour around!

Must Try:
-Bloody Mary! (one of the best I've had!)
-Fried Green Tomatoes
-Spicy Creole Shrimp and Grits

They are usually on a wait, but totally worth it!"
904188,"I got the carne tacos, which according to the menu had onion and bell pepper in addition to beef and cojita. I had a pile of meat, onions, cheese, and one single bell pepper strip spooned onto two tortillas, with the third tortilla practically bare off to the side. Also, they don't make their tortilla chips in house, I saw them refilling with a bag. Hmph. 

Food came out quickly, ambiance was great with the view and music so I'm not swearing it off, but...I expected better."
808660,"My friends and I have been there 3 times: Happy hours for 2 times and a regular dinner. Overall the half-priced small plates and cocktails in Happy Hour are FANTASTIC and it was a really good deal! But there were too many people coming in Happy Hour so the servers were busy. If you didn't wave them to come over, they would ""forget"" about you :(

Here I've got 5 small plates recommended: 
Steamed Penn Cove Mussels,  1/2 Shell Oysters, Roasted Pork Belly, Baked Goat Cheese, Dungeness Crab Cake.

Reservation in advance for dinner is definitely recommended to avoid waiting for a long time. But I was late for 15 minutes because of the traffic jam in downtown Bellevue. We had to wait again but luckily that's not too long. The food decoration looks good and theytaste awesome! Make sure to save some space for desserts as the entrÃ©e are quite large in portion. Also, their customer service were GREAT! Because we were going during the busiest dinner time, the time waiting for food must be a little longer. So they offered us a free CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e for dessert! How sweet! :)"
822659,"I went there on sunday evening with 2 friends. I ordered a spinach gorgonzola pizza, which was delicious. And the waiter was very polite and provided a very good service. Grazie Domani :)"
829993,"This is a tiny place, but the pizza is delicious. It is thin-style, and they give you giant scissors to cut the slices. No kidding! Perhaps this is Italian? I immediately broke my scissors, and the woman at the table next to us helped me put them back together, much to my wife's amusement.

We always seem to end up here Friday night, when it is absolutely packed. The beers are also good - they always have a Georgetown ale; last time it was Lucille's terrific IPA.

Looking forward to checking out happy hour here."
813107,"GREAT DINING EXPERIENCE.  

This was my first time but the second time for my sister and her husband.  Came here to celebrate her graduation and wanted to take me out to a nice place for diner.  Lily made us feel welcomed and made some recommendations (should have taken those recommendations, more on that later).  Took some pictures of all of us which I thought was strange but that was fine.

The its were the spaghetti with the sardines, petrale alla picatta, porcini funghi along with the chocolate lasagne for dessert.  Everything was done to perfection and presentation is outstanding.  You are looking into the kitchen so it is noisy, but it was fun to see David and the other cooks work in unison to create their wonderful dishes.  

Note:  As I mentioned earlier, it would have been best to order what was suggested.  We did this family style to we were able to enjoy the different foods.  I think we ordered just a bit too much.  Skip the appetizers, skip the bread, lay off the water.  Just taste the wine with your meal.  Ask Lily or your server about the specials and what would pair well with the meal.  

Next time , make the reservation, find out what is being served, and go for the specials."
806972,"Not a great experience.

Mojitos came with old, brown mint. We didn't say anything about this.

Club sandwich was missing the bacon. When the waiter came by and we mentioned it, he said he'd take care of it. 10 minutes later, he came back with a few slices of bacon on a plate. He says they'd be happy to comp a dessert, too.

We were on the deck in the shade and as there were 5 or 6 open tables in the sun, we asked to move, since it was chilly. Our server said he'd ask the manager. A few minutes later he came back and said the manager said no. I figured they were busy inside and were planning to seat people. We ordered another round of drinks (no more mojitos as the mint was funky.)

More tables in the sun cleared out and there was nobody waiting,  so we finally just decided to move into the sun (one table over). There were 10 open tables in the sun at this point, they weren't busy, and we hadn't seen the server in a while.

We didn't see our waiter for 20 or 30 more minutes, to the point where we weren't sure he realized we were still there (again, we moved one table over into the sun). We'd finished our drinks and had been sitting there for quite a while when he came by, dropped off the check and said nothing about the comped dessert for the bacon-less club.

We paid and left. Weirdest service I've ever gotten. The funky mint, missing bacon then offer of a dessert, being told we couldn't move to a table in the sun when there was no wait, and then the waiter disappearing for a long time and returning with the check instead of a dessert menu...just crummy.

Our total was over $70 for lunch and 2 drinks each, and for the service and quality, I will go elsewhere in the future."
1921729,"Romantic spot. It's a candlelit dinner so it's a good place to take dates. 

The bone marrow is ridiculously rich and flavorful. The scotch egg is a deep fried soft boiled egg. It's definitely a must! The wild boar sloppy joe is also really good. Fois gras Frits is a good starter and very flavorful as well. Service is excellent too!"
1897964,"I'm so excited that Li'l Woodys has come to Ballard.  Its a huge upgrade over Zaks that was there before them.  The burgers are really good, we love the ""Crack"" (french fries dipped in Molly Moon's milkshakes) and the atmosphere is awesome.  I hope they stay open later on the weekends like they do at the Capital Hill location."
1080046,"Four of us did a before Ramsey and an after Ramsey. The ""before"" was a first and last for us. Bad food, bad service and bad price. This was a couple of years ago. That's all I have to say about that. Pretty easy review. The ""after"" however was an excellent experience. 
It was a last minute ""let's go out for dinner"" move. We had no reservation. We arrived between 6-7pm. Not smart on our part. But what the heck. The hostess immediately greeted us. We told her we had four in our party and we had no reservation. Her face went from a smile to a curious type of look. She asked if we could wait for a moment and she left. She returned now, with a look of success and asked if we would mind sitting a little on the snug side. She pointed out the four top we would be sitting at. We gratefully excepted. Trust me when I say we have been in much tighter quarters than this. It was perfect. 
I had the chicken pot pie. For $11 it was worth every penny. My fiance had the beef stroganoff. The beef melted in your mouth. I cant recall the price of that dish. Who really cares it was good. 
Live music started as we were finishing. The musician, she sounded great for what we were able to listen to. 
The only downside (an easy fix) they were short on wine glasses. They didn't ask if we wanted another bottle of wine but they didn't hesitate to take our wine glasses as the young man announce ""sorry but we are out of wine glasses. Can I take yours?) So BUY MORE WINE GLASSES. This review would of been a five star if it wasn't for that. So all in all great food, great service and great price. Bon Appetite."
808615,"I got a coffee and a spinach breakfast burrito made fresh to order -the burrito was $5.95, and it was pretty big. 

The customer service was fine, the place was clean, and the food tastes good. I was happy with the place and would return if I were in the area again."
191435,"I love downtown Kirkland. But they are seriously lacking in good breakfast spots. I like being able to walk down from my boyfriend's apt for breakfast, and if we want eggs and what not, George's is pretty much the only option. 

The food is fine, but the service leaves a lot to be desired, and overall I think the place is overpriced for the quality of the food. The menu is different with more of a Greek influence, which I like. The omelets seem to be the way to go. But, I only come here out of convenience, not because the food is memorable in anyway."
807084,"I've been eating here for years.  I've also been to the one on Lake Bellevue.  If you're looking for high quality sushi, look no further.  The service is also great.  They have great sushi and non sushi menu items and will literally bend over backwards to make you whatever you want if it's not on the menu.  Each I Love Sushi location has a different menu, but you can order rolls from the other restaurants if you want.

My favorite menu items are the black cod, spicy tofu, spicy roll, paradise roll, copy roll, alaskan roll, dragon roll, caterpillar roll... I could list so many others.

Seriously, if you've never been here and you love sushi, check it out."
1910900,This is the best French Pastry I have had outside of France. Love it!
1758776,"First pick up a menu and find a seat, once you have made your selection head to the bar.

I was here for breakfast, ready to get some work done before my appointment in the city. This spot was most excellent, it was quite and comfy. The music wasn't my ideal choice but it was soft enough I could just ignore. I scoped out the place and found cozy spot (meaning back to the wall so no one can look over my shoulder).

Time to look at the menu- my staple for any breakfast spot is their version of Eggs Benedict; sadly I was there too early and its only served on the weekends. I went for something simple- Farmer's Breakfast (check out the pic), it smelled great and very hearty. The side of bacon was a little sad, they were paper thin, I was hoping for this juicy slices. My eggs were fluffy, sausage was juicy, the sourdough toast tasted homemade (no Wonder Bread here), and the potatoes were seasoned just right. I didn't even need ketchup, only a few splashes of Tabasco for my eggs.

The cup that my latte was served in it was a bit strange, the funnel shape made the first few sips just foam, I was about to take my spoon and skim off the foam in the mason jar.

The only disappointments were the thickness of the bacon and NO WiFi, cell service was a little blotchy as well (AT&T).

Reading other reviews, it seems like there maybe consistency issues."
952082,Service is good. Parking is good. The Reuben and corn pasta is fantastic!!! The Reuben is really is the best I've had.
793021,"We got to Ohana before Happy Hour was over. Ordered beer and pupus from the happy hour menu, and sushi/sashimi from the dinner menu.  Loved the Agedashi Tofu and Poke served with taro chips.  The sashimi was nice and fresh.  Staff was great.

The only downside... the tables are very closed together.  We were seated next to someone VERY loud.  They offered to move us when a table/booth opened up, but the loud party left before that.  It worked out fine.   Definitely going back!"
817340,"My family and I went here last year and had a horrible experience.  However, they hired a new manager who saw my review on yelp and invited us to try them again by sending us a restaurant credit.  I have to say that we were impressed with the turn around.  The staff put my 5yr old's order in immediately and the food was very good.  We got the kids Mac n' cheese - which was delicious and Ill now try their grown up versions.  My husband got a burger and sweet potato fries - which he said was just a good as the one at Molbecks (our favorite place for burgers), and I got the steak salad - and the steak was perfect - flavorful, cooked to my liking and tender.  We will definitely go back. Their daily specials looked good - from $1 oysters and all you can eat spaghetti (depending on the day).  

Cudos to the new management on the improvements!"
1227266,"Well, they really know what they're doing with the fish and chips. There's nothing quite like a crisp glass of hard cider to wash it all down. I wish they had a weekend lunch menu. It seems silly to pay dinner prices for lunch food. I also wish (I know I'm barking up the wrong tree here) that there were more veggie/pescatarian options. At some point I know I'll tire of the fish and chips."
997828,"The crust is thin but not so thin it's crunchy. The toppings are excellent: they are very generous with them, and they're fresh.  No canned olives or mushrooms here! I'd suggest that if you're getting olives, then ask them to go light since they're so salty and it's hard to taste anything but olives if there's too much. The chickpea salad with gold raisins, celery and vinaigrette is a great side - sweet, salty, crunchy, and vinegary flavors. They deliver and have an incredibly easy website to order on any device. Delivery is usually an hour or so after you've ordered. And, you can place your order hours before you want your pizza delivered. Nice for when you don't want to procrastinate!"
1725889,"This place could be a little tidier, but the food is wonderful.  Many healthy choices and plenty of room.  Kind of noisy but great."
922713,"Went here for late night happy hour on a Thursday and I was really impressed with the menu's variety and prices.  I had a Plum Cosmo (It was very delicious) and my date had Woodford and a  blue cheese sirloin steak plate.  Everything was half off and there were so many things to choose from.  I definitely wouldn't pay full price for the amount of food he received, but I felt like it was the right amount for what we paid.  

The server was attentive without being annoying.  The music wasn't too loud.  The bar area looked really classy and clean.  We will definitely be going back."
682279,"So I recently saw an episode of ""Kitchen Nightmares"" about a mom and pop restaurant in Brooklyn.  Gordon Ramsay took the restaurant and turned it into this place that looked incredibly fake and obviously trying too hard while paying little apparent attention to the food.  The end result reminded me a lot of Grub. 

I was so hungry when I went there that I figured anything would taste good but I still left disappointed.  My food and my gf's food looked like they put no energy into it; they must have spent all their thought on the gaudy interior."
1055274,"Went here for lunch. Delicious food! Had the french dip panini with the grilled onions and provolone. Really, really good! And the potato salad was good as well. Didn't drink the but tap menu looked awesome and was definitely extensive with lots of local choices."
1313291,"I've been here twice and it's been wonderful both times.  They have really great southern food--there's always something interesting and fun to try.  The food is excellent and it comes out really quickly.  I have also found the staff to be really friendly and courteous.  The atmosphere is especially fun--the owners have placed large photos of their ancestors, including Langston Hughes, all around the restaurant giving a strong sense of place and history.  All around, this place is a must-visit restaurant in the area."
2796108,"First thing you notice about this place is the attitude of the serving staff. They act like they are doing you a huge favor by acknowledging you. This is not a cutesy old-fashioned diner trick; they just think they are special. The food is OK and it does come quick. The prices are fine, but maybe a little too expensive for what you get. We had a group of 6 so they automatically gave themselves a nice gratuity (their attitudes warranted a 5% tip). OK place, but there are a lot of better options nearby."
810781,"One of my favorite spots in Washington. I want some of there Hot and Sour Tofu soup now. I can't wait to go back next time i'm in Washington. Every time i've eaten here I was pleased. My last visit was over a year ago so I cant remember what else i've had, but I want some of there Hot anc Sour Tofu soup now. The reason for this review."
1673165,"A nice place to try some spicy ""indian"" style burgers. 
Their chicken masala burger is tasty albeit a little too dry(overcooked chicken). The fries are ok and a little under-seasoned but they do give you seasoning on the side to add to taste. The jalapeÃ±o poppers are excellent. Very fresh and perfectly seasoned. 
I asked the owner/chef to recommend his favorite and he suggested I try the ""Philly Cheesesteak Burger"". It was very delicious. Forget your calorie counter at home when you try this bad boy. The only downside was that it had been sitting on the counter for a while until they made my friend's chicken burger and my burger bun had gotten really soggy due to that. They really should toast the bun on this one to prevent that from happening.
Overall the food was not bad and the people were friendly but I had to dock off one more star for a cockroach that was running around on the floor. I know it's a small place tucked away in U-district but that's no excuse to not keep it clean and pest free. 
I'll probably go back here when I'm in the area since the taste reminds me of burgers we used to eat back at home. I hope they sort out their roach problems and soggy buns soon though."
835649,"Not worth it, at this location!!!

Twice now my boyfriend and I have been to this Red Robin and had bad experiences. The trip there is just not worth their refillable steak fries and their wonderful seasoning. The first time was about a year ago - it was busy and they were slammed but when we first walked in and were blatenly ignored by the hostess, that was it for us. She didn't even turn around to acknowledge that we had walked in, but she was standing right next to the door. Um, no thank you! 

The second time, which was this last weekend, we popped in b/c their food sounded great and we were in the area. The hostess still had her back to us, but at least turned around this time when we walked in. Another girl walked up to her complaining that she didn't have a name tag but politely showed us to our table. Being just us two, I figured they would sit us a two-person booth rather than a normal 4-person one, but didn't expect her to walk us past every available option to potentially seat us down in the child birthday party area!! Um, the last thing we want is to barely hear each other over our food b/c of kids screaming in excitement and/or loud conversations!! Especially when the servers were already having trouble walking around each other down there AND we had passed several open 2-top tables before she'd led us there. 
My boyfriend and I glanced at each other, walked back towards the other options and asked if we could be seated here instead. The server politely said yes and walked away. There we sat awaiting our drinks or anything, reviewing the menu for what we were going to eat. Several servers walked by us and not a single one stopped to take our drink order or ask us anything. We decided to leave when a table got sat beside us and immediately got their drinks. I told him that I bet the girl didn't bother to tell anyone that we had been sat in their area and we both decided to get up and go. We had waited about 5 whole minutes before leaving, and even after we had already decided what we wanted to eat. Even when we left, no one acknowledged us - not even the girl who sat us who watched us walk out or the hotess by the front door. 

I hate to sound like that ""old"" nag again but seriously!!! What is with teenager/20-somethings not giving good customer service! I don't go to these places to judge and critique, by the way. We went b/c we truely wanted to enjoy their food, drinks and atmosphere and again have been dissappointed. Mind you, that I've only gotten bad service from this location when I've gone with my boyfriend. I've gone other times with my girl friends and have received mediocre service -- still nothing great, but better than left to wait with no acknowledgment or service. Like I said above -- this location SUCKS!"
172577,"Classic, delicious, comforting food. 

I have seen Queen City Grill many times over the years and had been wanting to try it for quite some time. They were established in 1987.

I had the duck confit and my dinner date had the oxtail stew. We both thoroughly enjoyed the food. We also had a Cotes du Rhone which was very tasty. 

I almost always order duck if it's an option on the menu so I was pleased to see it being offered. The accompanying veggies and couscous were delicious. I ate every bite.

The service was professional and warm but not overbearing in the least. I got the impression that the man serving us may have been the owner but I'm not sure. 

My only gripe was the high backed wooden booths. There is a barrier on the end which makes getting in and out of the booths very awkward. If you hit yourself on this barrier it will hurt. 

This would be an ideal spot to tuck away and get lost in conversation. The atmosphere is simple and classic but also a bit romatic. Good date spot. 

Overall, Queen City is a solid, classy place for a nice dinner when in Belltown. I can see why it's been around for 25 years and I can see it being around for many more years to come."
809122,"Dinner with hus. and son.  Excellent!  Good food, good drinks, excellent service.  Even a little candle for the birthday boy's ice cream.  

Why not 5 stars?  Because all 3 of us felt that several of the dishes we had were far too salty (and not because they naturally come that way) - so our request for the chef and kitchen would be to hold back on the salt a bit.  People can always ADD that stuff - eh?

Otherwise, delightful.  Must've been, we spent 2+ hours there!"
1110828,"""We're going to take the ball- and we're going to score!""  One of my favorite moments in Seahawks history, but also for sports in general.  Any Seahawk fan will remember that moment when Matty won the overtime toss during a playoff game against the Packers and made such a bold claim...alas, the Seahawks did not score...but that's not the point.

So, when I saw the sign in bold writing ""WEST SEATTLE'S BEST FISH AND CHIPS"" planted for everyone to see driving on Oregon- I was reminded of that moment in Seahawks history.

I mean, that is a HUGE statement of faith in your FNCs- we've got living legends:  Sunfish and Spud's to name only two institutions.  I've heard rumors of a place on 35th too, so man- way to throw it out there Highstrike...I appreciate the balls.

SO, I made my way in after a long day at work near the end of the summer.  The inside decor is clean and somewhat reminiscent of a 90s era semi- chain restaurant or something...I wasn't really there for the ambience though.  It was cool to hear the bowling going on behind me as I watched the Mariners lose on some big screens in front of me.

I mentioned to the waitress the sign outside and she said to give it a shot, with a wry smile- I couldn't tell if she believed what was stated or if she thought my socks would be blown off.  She mentioned that each order is made to order and the fish is brought in fresh each day...so, we were getting off to a good start.

The fish:  well, it's a little different- but different isn't bad.  In fact, I was diggin' it.  It's more of a panko- like batter, which was super crispy, and freaking hot.  Not too greasy, and the fish was flakey.  Again, different than what I'm used to, but the more I ate the more I liked.  The fries were awesome, great addition of pepper on them, and had a really great flavor.  I enjoyed it, I really did.  I can't say it's West Seattle's BEST, but it's a runner up for sure.  I do appreciate the bravado to put that out there- and I will be back again."
2125388,"First, just expect to wait. This place is popular, so keep this in mind if you are very hungry. That said, once you are close to getting a table, you can order an appetizer and drink that will basically be waiting for you when you are seated. 

We started with the fresh spring rolls and they were fantastic. The sauce had the perfect amount of heat and the cilantro was so fresh. I ordered the Pad Thai and WOW. Loved it.  I had it with tofu and thought it was cooked perfectly. I like spicy food and got a #5 heat. Didn't regret a thing. 

Our server was very attentive and portion sizes are perfect."
1644639,"Every dish reminded me of a bouquet of flowers, only it was a bouquet of food.  Plating was stunning and food was solid.  I arrive during happy hour and tried the foie gras.  The candied orange zest on the foie gras was different, but delicious.  It helped cut the richness of the foie.  On the regular menu, I had the Big Eye Tuna and  Tagliatelle.  Both were very good.  The Big Eye Tuna also had foie gras.  The dish was not heavy and very well balanced.  For dessert I had the Chocolate, coffee, butterscotch fudge, sorbet, crumble.  As I already mentioned, everything was very beautiful and neatly put together.  I enjoyed the different levels of flavors and the visual aspects.  It was a very solid experience.

Atmosphere was good.  Although I was there during the 4th quarter of the Seahawks vs 49ers game.  This is not a place to be loud and expressive.  I had to stop myself a few times."
1672875,"Bummer...went here last night and had a good happy hour and thought I would come again since the sunshine is still out.  Should not have...I sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice, nothing negative to say about his service.  I started with some bread that had a long hair in it, didn't say anything, I mean things happen.  Then I ordered the salmon off the HH menu, it came (30 mins later)  totally raw and cold, mashed potatoes cold too (I actually prefer mine a little undercooked, but this wouldn't even pull away from the skin).  When the bartender asked how it was I showed him and he immediatly took it away.  I was a little surprised when he came back with it, it was my same pulled apart piece of salmon I had taken a few bites from just cooked a little longer. the HH salmon is like an inch wide, wouldn't break you to just give someone a fresh one.  So now I'm running late to pick up my daughter because of the send back etc., I go to pick up my car which was in valet and of course nobody there, i spot a guy out in the lot who looks at me, but doesn't say anything, like 'be there in a minute', so I wait a little bit and then since there are only a few keys and i'm running late I just grab them to help the guy out.  i even go out to him, still hand him a tip and say 'im running late, thx but I can just grab my car' as I walk away he's like 'in the future, please don't touch the keys' what?? 1. someone should have been there, not my fault you're understaffed because of a staff party that's going on (heard some people talking about it) and 2. I just tipped you and I'm the customer."
2795074,"Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the guy making my food touch his nose. I only had 10 minutes before I had to head to work. I weighed my options- food or no food, as OCD as I am, out of hunger, I convinced myself I was mistaken about what I saw. Despite this- the fish and chips were solid- crisp, fresh, and tasty."
810012,"Went in for lunch.  The waitress let us order WAY too much food (it's very easy to do)

Make sure you ask about items that are un-clear.  The ceviche is gross; it's pureed!

The Guacamole is good, but it is expensive.  Our waitress just brought it to the table, being somewhat deceptive like it came with our meals :(

Less than authentic food, but they have an expensive place to pay for, so there you go."
519035,"Amazing pizza. Great service!

I recommend the ""Stampede"".

My only complaint is that some of the appetizers and non-pizza menu items are mediocre at best, but then again it's a pizza place."
863696,"I'll start this review off by letting you know I still dream about the flavorful Belgian Waffle with brie, basil, and bacon. What a genius brunch menu item, right?

I was with a few of my cousins when we discovered this brunch spot. It was cousin Rachel's wedding day so we knew we needed to begin the occasion with mimosas and a taste of the Seattle local flavor. 

We, sat, we ordered, and we laughed over coffee while sitting on the lovely patio. Then, about 45 minutes later we pondered the whereabouts of our food. The laughing began to decline as we realized our extreme hunger and how we found ourselves in a bit of a rush. We asked with a smile if they knew when our food was going to come out and got an abrupt ""I don't know"" answer. When we tried to explain we had to make our way to a wedding soon, the waitress gave an ""I don't care"" shrug and that was that. 

About 20 minutes later our food did arrive. Everyone was pleases with their tasty food, but I wouldn't recommend the mimosas (a bit overpriced for champagne to juice ratio.)

I'm not hungup on this cafe, if I were asked if I wanted to try it out again I'd give it a shot!"
901479,Excellent decor which makes for great ambiance. Food was decent with good serving sizes. Prices were competitive. Service was extremely fast on a Saturday evening at dinner time. Definitely recommend.
624570,"I am never eating here again. I was so excited to try Aloha's Ramen that I drove from Tacoma (about an hour drive) and man, was I disappointed and disgusted. 
I ordered their Aloha ramen with fried rice. The fried rice was good....nothing too special. I took my first slurp of the ramen and felt something plasticky in my mouth. So I pulled this LONG ASS PLASTIC STRING (looked like floss) out of my mouth and lost my appetite instantly. YUCK! I should report this to the health department. I could have swallowed that plastic string! The owner gave me a free drink to make up for it but didn't want to eat/drink anything from the restaurant afterwards. 

I am never going back."
172637,"I know that the word on the street among my comrades, the hipster foodies, is that this place is awesome. Well, I hate to be a naysayer, but my experience here sucked, especially compared to the hype.

Ambiance: I've been to lots of bars where part of the shtick is that you have to wait for a while to get inside, and I'm fine with that, it can sort of heighten the mystique, get you pumped up for the experience, whatever. However, I've never waited anywhere with a 3-part queue -- outside in the cold, inside in the tiny entryway, and then at a standing room only area... And I've *never* waited so long for such small payoff. Lame. 

Drinks: yuck. First of all, the bartender was busy chatting some people up, and moving around with great bravado, so it took forever to get served. Then he gave my boyfriend the wrong drink. Then he mangled his actual order, their signature drink - the foam on top was all weirdly deflated and the cannon image, which I've heard can turn out quite cool looking, was just an ugly red smear. 

Nothing on their (one-note) menu sounded good to me, so I ended up with the Shrouded Roulette (""tell us your base spirit and we'll create the mystery - every recipe secret and unique!""). I asked the bartender to make me something spicy with tequila, which turned out to be something bland and unidentifiable as tequila-based. Certainly not worth $10.

All in all, I feel like this place had a poor design, an unapologetically poor bartender (maybe their others are better), and an overpriced selection of unappetizing food and bevs. Everything was, in a word, pretentious. Nothing looked unhygienic and no one was outright rude, so 2 stars it is.

If you want a bar that feels hip and exclusive, you'll get a better bang for your buck at Tavern Law or Knee High Stocking Co."
906834,"I had visitors from France who wanted to eat good seafood in Seattle.  So I was under lot of pressure to take them to a good restaurant, chose Ivars based on the yelp rating and I am so glad I wasn't wrong. Everyone loved the food, service and ambiance.
For me, I had grilled Ling-cod fish on a risotto cake. It was delicious."
898133,"Update from 8/26/13 experience:
Family dinner. I was kind of ""iffy"" on returning with a big party after my previous experience... We had 13 people total. Which to my surprise, my experience was a complete 180. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked it. Our server was very swift and to the point. After we'd ordered our food we had no issues with trying to figure out who's was what... which was awesome. No problems with the bill or extra food being delivered/or on the receipt. Everything was great... i was truly surprised at how different our experience was... Maybe the previous experience was just a bad day... 

Review from 6/28/13:
I've been to this place multiple times now. I really enjoy there buttered chicken with naan bread which is what keeps me coming back. I've tried other foods here, but nothing else seems to compare to the buttered chicken. 

Anyway, so yesterday, I recommended this place for a friends birthday dinner. We had a party of 8 people. After we'd ordered, the service from this point began going downhill at a fast rate... 

1. When our food was brought out... the servers just placed everyones order on the table, not necessarily pairing it with whom ever ordered what. This caused a lot of confusion on our parts throughout out meal. 

2. We'd ordered 3 extra orders of naan bread, which we never received. 

3. They gave us an extra ordered of buttered chicken which no one had ordered

4. When the bills came, they were completely inaccurate.. 

5.6.7.8.9.10. No one came to our table to check on us to see if everything was ""ok,"" like a waiter typically would do at any restaurant... after we were done eating and ready to pay, 2 waiters came to our table and began cleaning our table. At that moment i'd mentioned that 3 orders of our naan breads never came out... the waiter looked at me and completely ignored what i said, by asking me instead, if he can remove the empty rice bowl off the table... This was very weird and uncomfortable. We figured that our bills wouldn't reflect the items we didn't receive as well as the extra buttered chicken they gave. WRONG! Everything was added to the bill including an additional drink that wasn't ordered. Our bill was originally split in 3 and each party had an issue. After we'd told the waiter of the discrepancies, instead of him being polite and understanding their error... he began arguing that they'd placed multiple orders of naan breads in various baskets. That we did in fact order that extra buttered chicken... he couldn't tell us who ordered it but he kept insisting someone did... After having us put all our bills on the table for him to examine, he did admit that they charged us for an extra drink we never ordered.... This made us very uneasy and we decided instead of arguing with him and making this a bigger deal than it may have been, we would just pay for the unordered or missing items on the bill since they choose to be so cheap and unprofessional about their mistake. (Overall, these mistakes were unresolved for about 30+min, they took forever fixing the bill with the drink and their arguing and refusal to properly serve their customers, felt like 2 high school girls having a cat fight)

I would not recommend this place for a party of 5+... we've had a similar issues in the past but this experience was over the top and completely unprofessional and inappropriate customer service."
803290,"This place stands out as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the minute you pull up to the door, it's first class service. This is not for someone looking for value, it's very expensive. If you are looking for an overall dining experience and money is not a consideration, this is the place to go in seattle. Fantastic wine selection. The food is outstanding too."
1481233,"Fresh, made to order food and really, really good! Nice to find a high quality restaurant that isn't a franchise in the Tri-Cities.

I had the hummus and flat-bread. The portions on this are easy to share with a group of four people or so. 

I also had a Gyro which had a ton of flavor and was made fresh. Highly recommend this spot the next time you're in the mood for Greek food."
1325667,This restaurant continues to impress me every time I go back! The atmosphere is exciting and the restaurant buzzes with conversation and music. Cactus changes their tamale option and specials every day which keeps me coming back to see what the chef has next. Also the Margaritas are awesome and the staff is friendly and attentive. Only downsides are you may need to wait for a table during peak hours and they sometimes run out of tamales is you go too late!
1644739,"Above average typical seafood joint.  I had a salmon sampler which, although good, the salmon was overcooked and dry.  Nice selection and choice of items.  Nothing spectacular, nothing bad.  We had appetizers of their goat cheese dip, calamari and manilla clams.  Seafood sampler for entree and fish and chips. All acceptable.  Overall good place to go."
1005731,"I am so glad I found this place.  I had been saying that we needed a dumplings to go restaurant in the Ballard/Greenwood area just a few weeks ago.  The shrimp balls are as good as I have had at any International District restaurant...the taro, the fried dumplings and the shui mei are all quite good.  My children really liked the custard and meat baos.  To top it all off, our bill was less than $20 for three of us and we at VERY well.  They are a fraction of the price of nicer sit-down restaurants but the food is top notch.  I would stay away from the Big Bao and the Curry Chicken Bao though...those were not so tasty."
839343,"Great prices for Happy Hour drinks and food and runs until 6:00pm, which is nice for those of us who can't get out of the office until 4:30/5pm. Good selection of drinks and food to choose from. Was really excited about the Chicken Lettuce Wraps but they did not live up to the hype - overall a great experience."
810253,"Whats amazing about this place, not that it's a pretty yummy crepe, or the friendly service, or the cook that goes out of his way to offer a table, bar top, high-chair, etc...

It's the fact that you get two large crepes, for an inexpensive price.  What we paid and what we got, I felt like we're stealing from them."
2149165,Best Oysters I've had in a really long time. Cannot get any fresh and great oysters like this in cali so I took advantage of it and shared 3 dozen. Service is great as well.
1710142,"I just seriously love this place. Here are my tips:

*Eat in the bar, if you can. The female bartender is very sweet, and a great server. Just the right amount of service, not too little and not too much (there's a fine line). 

*Happy hour is 4-6. And their happy hour options are awesome. The $1.50 shitake satay is DELICIOUS. The chicken satay is really good too. $6.50 for a small pho tai, and it's plenty of food (especially with the appetizers we get). 

*The sausage, lemongrass soup is divine. Whatever kind of rice they use in it is so tasty. The second time I ordered it, it was a little bit too salty.

All of the various dipping sauces that come with their satays and appetizers are also tantalizing. I'm having trouble coming up with different words for ""delicious.""

This place uses authentic Vietnamese ingredients. Everything I've eaten here is delicious, and we find it hard to eat anywhere else when we're in downtown. Why would we go somewhere more expensive, with less delicious food? Affordable and scrumptious: Long Provincial."
875978,"Their turkey and havarti sandwiches with their stone ground mustard on a croissant are incredible! would DEFINITELY recommend this place, even if you're not from west seattle... totally worth the drive. YUMMY!"
1951804,"I was at Tulios last night with my wife. It was the our anniversary, and the staff made special the evening. The service was great and the food was delicious. Warm atmosphere and great drinks too, we definitely will be back."
1771602,"The sandwiches are ok, but I love the oreo/coffee mix ice cream shakes!"
959054,"Very busy most of the time there is a long wait. But the food is delicious, waiters are friendly but take a while to come back and check to make sure everything is ok."
1092534,"DO NOT BUY THE $20 for $30!!!! THEY WON'T ACCEPT IT!!!

Love this place, but wasted my money on the yelp deal. They told us YELP hasn't paid them their share, so they don't accept it. Bummer...."
1970690,"DEEEEELICIOUS! I'm a Thai food connoisseur so I can say with confidence that I've tried a LOT of different Thai food places in the area and elsewhere.  This place takes a while to deliver but I think it's because of the size of the restaurant and number of staff.  They're extremely polite and very friendly.  Great service, excellent food.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer that had a few onion rings and battered broccoli that were delicious and well seasoned.  Crispy not soggy and very good.  Also the pad Thai and the pad see ew.  Fresh, tasty and quite reasonable with decent proportions.  Will definitely order again! Yummy!"
962925,Bad service. Made reservation at 8:30pm and hostess told us to wait 10 mins when we get there. 10 mins became 50 mins and still no seats. What's the point of making reservation? Don't take reservation if you don't intend on keeping it! Would not recommend this restaurant unless you prepared to wait for an hour or more to get seated.
1642918,"I want to be a regular customer at this place because I love Mexican food and live nearby. However, I have ordered out on two occasions and had the buyer's remorse both times. They are extremely rude and slow. I felt like I needed to apologize for ordering food...
The quantity of food was small for the price. I expected much more. The food seemed mediocre, but my image was already stained of the place and was probably influencing my taste buds. I will never go here again."
1688912,"omy, what a hidden gem! in a search for seattle's best burgers, we stumbled upon this place. it's not fancy at all; i think there were a total of 3 tables and one of the tables was an old pacman game refurnished into a table. only two people working there. between the two of us, we got the spidey's web (mushroom burger), the lil daredevil (jalapeno burger), and the GLORIOUS phoenix fries. burgers were juicy and big and messy and dripping with addictive liquid fat. the fries -- OH YES!!!!!!!!!!! waffle fries are my favorite type of fries. i don't know what it is about them -- perhaps they make for beautiful art with asymmetrical intersections and unexpected junctions. anyway, whatever it may be, they makes waffle fries taste superior to normal fries. but these weren't just normal waffle fries, they were topped with some type of spicy aioli sauce (maybe spicy sriracha mayo) and grilled onions and crispy BACON BITS AND JALAPENOS. by the time i finished that sentence, i was TYPE-YELLING."
919894,Best Banh mi!!!
670296,"Open 24 hours? This place is dangerously delicious, you'll be in hipster heaven here. Especially if you try the $2.50 cheeseburger during HH!

I happened to be here just past 2am last Friday night and found the food and service to be outstanding. I reserve 5 star reviews for businesses that exceed my expectations and Lost Lake had me at a loss for words. 

Now keep in mind that you're getting diner food here, but that said, it's excellent. My friends and I walked in at about 2:40AM and the place was packed. In fact, there was a line out the door!  But after waiting no more than just a minute or two, we were up. The door guy politely told us there might be a wait but if we were willing to squeeze into a two-top, the three of us could be seated right away. Being good friends we saw no issue with 3 chairs at a 2 seater table so we opted for the small table and ordered our food ASAP. I tried the hashbrowns, toast, eggs (over easy) and bacon. My friend Anya had the tuna melt and my boyfriend opted for a big ol' plate of poutine. After about a 10-15 minute wait our food was ready and came out piping hot. Water kept getting refilled, more orders came out... It didn't appear to be 2:40AM here! I was really amazed at how well this new business handled the crowd and really appreciated that the waitstaff was patient and friendly even though about half of the patrons were drunk. (Not us!)

My breakfast dish was perfect. The hashbrowns were nice and browned, the eggs were perfect and I loved the rye toast. My bacon was a little overdone but it's bacon. It's delicious no matter what! I tried the tuna melt and loved it. Definitely a must order if you're a sando or tuna fan. The poutine was also good. I'd come back and order each item all over again - and then some! I'm dying to come back and try the fried chicken, the waffles, and of course pop by for a drink sometime. Definitely an awesome addition to Capitol Hill!"
1936790,"Pretty good. I would come here again. Service was fast and friendly, and they gave us a complimentary dessert. Awesome!"
789913,"We arrived on a Sunday morning; which I understand means we are coming at a busy time. Given that, it did not warrant the experience I had.

It took almost 40 minutes to get our food which arrived cold with sauces and eggs congealed from sitting to long.

When I complained to the general manager, he was abusive to myself and the server. He refused to take the substandard items off my check. I understand paying for the items that were eaten, but he still charged me items I sent back.

I am never coming back to this dump.

I would discourage anyone eating here and that general manager should be fired because he clearly does not have the basic level of people skills needed to do his job.

I will be calling their corporate office about my experience. I hope they are more responsive than this location's management."
2516133,"This was our go-to spot for a ""high-class"" dinner since there was someone in my group that does not eat seafood. This means no Elliot's or any other oyster bars in the area. 

I had the Sturgeon plate and it was jam-packed with unique flavors! I never had an experience with kale like that before but every single bite was delicious. 

My friends had the rib-eye and man, it was an even better dish than the seafood plate I had. there was a nice char taste to it and it was actually quite a big piece of steak. 

We also got a bottle of white wine, but instead, they gave us a bottle of Merlot. They opened it so that we may ""taste"" it before but my friends decided to just take the bottle regardless. We're not wine connoisseurs.

Of course, this restaurant is not a place that you can stuff your face in but is a great place to have a nice dinner before exploring the city. The ambiance and the location made it a great place to experience and it really set the tone for my trip to Seattle."
666570,"My companion and I came here for lunch during weekdays. It's easy to find becase it's right in between LA Fitness and AMC Bowling. You won't have problems with parking. 

I arrived first, signed up, and probably waited for 5 mins. Then, we got seated. The restaurant itself is fairly big. For some reason, it smelled very greasy! When I walked towards to where I got seated, it was slippery. 

Food was ok. Well, you get what you pay for. So, I shouldn't complain. The service was good. The server stopped by a few time filling up our tea. Between two of us, we only ate $23 worth of food.  Small appetite I guess!"
811328,"When coming to Little Thai, stick to the noodle dishes like Pad Thai or Pad See Ew or the spicy whole fish. I've tried the Tom Yum and it is not good. It lacks flavor. I've had to ask for them to make it sweeter.  Even after getting it back, it tasted better but it's still not good at all. I even tried it again after the first time and it was the same, which confirms my suspicion that this place isn't meant for Tom Yum.

The service is great! The older Thai lady is so nice and remembers me and my friends every time we come.

I will still come back for the other food, but will stick to other places for my beloved Tom Yum."
1117669,"Tried Monsoon for the first time as part of Dine Around Seattle. We couldn't believe how many options they had on their Dine Around menu! Most restaurants don't spend lots of energy on this promotion and sometimes treat patrons poorly when they come in specifically for Dine Around. Not Monsoon! We had wonderful, attentive servers, AMAZING food, and huge portion sizes. I couldn't believe the size of the Dine Around portions! We had tons of leftovers that made an excellent lunch the next day. 

Recommended:
Pork ribs appetizer (a large entree size)
Appetizer that is steak wrapped in a leaf
Cabbage and prawn salad
Eggplant
Crispy Tofu
Drunken Chicken
Prawns and Yellow Curry
Clay Pot Catfish

We loved everything! Thanks Monsoon!"
886371,"I simply hate that Mighty-O is just so damn awesome! It's hard to make a decision with such tasty variety. Thankfully they offer mini donuts so you can try a couple without narrowing down to just one. I try to avoid unhealthy eating, but every year I come to Seattle, and every year we frequently stop in for quick bite...and we also take a dozen home. It's the guilty pleasures in life...

Oh and they have Vegan Donuts - SCORE!"
852869,"I went to Etta's with my roommate and friends for her birthday, which was my first time at a Tom Douglas restaurant. We had made reservations ahead of time because it was also restaurant week. I was instantly very impressed by the ambiance. Beautiful glass lamp decorations (and glass ducks along an upper shelf) are fitting for this restaurant's near-Pike Place location. 

All six of us had basically the same 3 courses chosen from the restaurant week selections. I personally had the mussels, the signature ""rub with love"" salmon, and sour cherry sorbet for dessert. The mussels were probably the best I've had in a long time - fresh and a nice, heaping portion for an appetizer. I really like the salmon, too, which was served with bread pudding (yum) and asparagus -- all of which was a great portion. I'm not sure if this differed much from the salmon that is offered on the regular menu, but I will definitely order it again when I come back! Sorbet was good, but nothing too different than what I could get at an ice cream shop. However, most of my friends LOVED their sundae which was served with chocolate cake, ice cream, and the sorbet. Due to my dairy allergy, I couldn't join them in what sounded like an awesome dessert. 

Service was excellent. My water glass was constantly full (I always use this as an indicator of quality of service) and our server gave my friend a free glass of sangria for her birthday (score)!

Definitely will be back to try the crab cakes!"
797002,"Wow, this place is fantastic!  The food is great, service is pretty fast.

Love the warm artichoke sandwich!

What I love most about this place is their commitment to healthy food.  They won't sell artificial flavors, high fructose crap or any of the other chemicals you typically find at most other restaurants.

Love the fresh juice options!"
798851,"Great place, reasonable price, nice service

I used a groupon here.

Got whatever the mixed bbq deal is with the beef, chicken, and ribs.

Very happy with the food.  It aint cheap, but BBQ never is. The price for the amount of food you get and the quality is reasonable. 

Although I got my order to go, the servers were nice made sure I got everything I needed.

Recommend to do at least once with a good buddy to just pig out with a cold one."
884174,"I went there with a couple of friends for lunch over there.  The interior was really beautiful; there's also a great party room as well.  I was then surprised by the price.  It is pretty fair considering the visual experience.  My friends can't take spicy food so we just had everything 1 star, which I somewhat regret. I especially liked their leaf wrapped grilled chicken starter.  I will definitely bring my spicy food loving friends for a second try."
1443278,"I'm always a big fan of Mondello's and it makes me feel like I'm back in Italy! Just about everything is delicious. Unlike some other reviewers, I've ALWAYS had great service during each visit over the past few years- there when you need them but not overly intrusive. Only one negative is that sometimes the menu descriptions don't seem to be the same as what actually comes out (for example last time we ordered the lasagna with bÃ©chamel sauce, but it just had red sauce when it came out) but regardless the food was still super yummy! My favorite is always the ravioli Marsala. And the seasoned dipping sauce for bread is AMAZING. Portion sizes tend to be more ""Italian"" in my opinion (which isn't a bad thing- but don't go in expecting an Olive Garden style ridiculously sized plate of food- servings are usually perfect for one!) great wine, and often you'll find ""Nonna"" in there at the counter-she's so sweet!!"
1673164,There is a great collection of Indian burgers. It is very tasty and much better than any other burger for Indian taste. The staff is very friendly and ready to serve and your leisure.
2137574,"Me and my wife had been so far 3/4 times at this place. It has been great and we like the food, drinks, service & the nice ambience. Brings a little spiciness in the Nordic Ballard ;). We will be back for sure. I am repeating the review for yelp acct. issues, olso giving 5 stars this time ;)."
1003266,"Stopped by for brunch on the way home from a camping trip on the peninsula.  Nice little hole in the wall place. Great place for breakfast-very Oly.  Staff was friendly, service responsive.  My kid had a panda pancake with the blackberry jam and was in heaven.  My hubby had the Monte Cristo sandwich, which he reports was also top notch.  I had one of the egg specials with the rice patties on the side.  I wasn't wowed by the rice patties/cakes, but it doesn't detract from my overall dining experience. Love the journals on the tables for doodling or reviewing.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in Olympia!"
679853,"got the smoked salmon chowder, good not great. Wish they didn't make their standard chowder with bacon though, seems like everyone in Seattle does that which is very odd for other cities."
1660050,"Four of us went to visit Poquitos on a busy Friday night, we were definitely happy that we got reservations, or we could've been waiting a long time.  Of the four of us, we had 2 meat eaters, 1 veggie & 1 pescetarian.  No one was thrilled with their food.

The starter of a novelty pineapple/ pepper guacamole was really nice, and their tortilla chips were DELISH (some of the best chips I've had in a while!).  The margaritas were tasty, but pricey, considering that they were very small glasses filled mostly with ice.  The main dishes is where everyone wasn't thrilled.  

The veggie had a vegetarian mole with tortillas, but the mole was like a soup -- so you couldn't even wrap anything.  The meat eater also had a mole (I can't remember if it was chicken?) and it was so hot/ spicy, she had a tough time eating it.  This is coming from a girl who lives for spicy Asian food too.  The two moles looked NOTHING alike -- one was light brown and soupy, the other dry as a bone and blackened.  They were both confused.  The halibut fish special was probably the best thing there, our friend did seem to enjoy that.  The fish tacos left much to be desired -- not really flavorful, not really interesting.

We had a couple of friends recommend Poquito's to us, one of them is a vegetarian.  Being that we have veggies in our family, I was confused as what the heck this guy eats -- there is ONE veggie dish on the entire menu (which was that soupy mole).  Maybe the food has changed over time?  Who knows.

I'm still on the hunt for that great, authentic Mexican.  NEXT!"
823911,"We saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and the food looked amazing, so when we were in Spokane we had to visit. And I'm so glad we did!

Staff are friendly and attentive, but not overly so. But the best reason to come is for the food. 

I was longing to try the BBQ Chicken Quesadilla. When it came out, it didn't look fancy, but who cares, it tasted fantastic. And the smoked onion dip that comes with it is beyond amazing. There is a decent selection of beers, particularly canned and bottles from some small breweries that I've never heard of. I was particularly fond of a Hawaiian pineapple wheat beer."
2133098,"I had no idea this place even existed; even though the nail salon I go to is in the same building... on the same floor, even!

The abobada tacos... I'm drooling, just thinking about them. The pork is seasoned beautifully and that little slice of grilled pineapple.. Yum! 

It literally looks like a hole in the wall - very unassuming but ridiculously delicious! And the guys who run the place (I think?) are super friendly. Can't wait to go back for more~"
834039,"We found this place through a google search after getting off the Bolt Bus from Portland. When I looked a little deeper, I found an article saying the place had been shut down for some pretty atrocious hygiene issues recently. But then we saw all these positive reviews and decided to hope that they turned it around. 

Well I don't know what it was like before, but we were happy we went. It was a little confusing upon first walking in -- what are all these things in the trays? do we order at the counter or sit down first?

Luckily, a woman (perhaps the owner) quickly showed us to a table and handed us menus. She was super super nice and sweet. The tofu banh mi was yummy and perfect for lunch. It was also super cheap, which is always nice."
1737124,"My wife already left a review, but I have to second the notion we've been here many times its always been nice. This particular time is the first time we ordered a lunch dish called pulled pork tacos and I can't speak to the other tacos,  maybe they were good , one was a fish and the other  chicken. They were done on a small corn tortillas like street style. But ours simply were not good, they were very dry, and the sauce they put in the center,  I assume to pour into the taco to moisten it up was not edible, at least to us. So we each ate one very dry taco and left the other two for the waitress to clear away and had our only disappointing meal ever at Stanley. Still four stars, why?  Because of the countless other visits that all went without a single complaint. Very nice place we highly recommend it."
693913,"Tom Douglas, a name that comes up countless times in numerous publications and on the Food Network for having some of the top food in the industry.  With such a pedigree comes a pretty hefty price tag for food that is supposed to showcase the pinnacle of his cuisine.  Given the chance to taste it at a lower cost during Seattle Restaurant Week was a no brainer.  What I received though in return was far from what I was expecting.

Tucked away in one of the business streets in down town Seattle, upon entering, the dÃ©cor was warm and welcoming.  Even though the establishment was not even half full, it bode well to expect that it meant the service would be even more attentive than they would be on a busy night.  Unfortunately, disappointment would end up being the overall theme of the night.  Taking advantage of the 3-course meal, it started off with arancini, cauliflower soup, and a beet salad.  All were very pleasant and light, a great start to the meal.  Next,the orders of flank steak, tagliatelli, and capelletti arrived. The capelletti was the highlight of the meal with well cooked pasta and savory mushrooms that were deliciously lightened with the crispness of arugula.  The flank steak was grilled and seasoned well, though the radicchio was undercooked and underseasoned leaving too much of a bitter flavor after only two bites.  The tagliatelli, however, was the low point of the meal.  The pasta was fresh but well past overcooked, and the heavy handed dressing sopped the plate of oil with only a hint of brown butter goodness.  The night finished with some decent desserts (the chocolate budino tasted like the inside of a Lindt truffle!), but even ending on that high note was not enough to salvage the poor opinion my fellow diners and I felt when we left.  On top of the mediocre food, our server had forgotten a couple of side dishes we ordered, and left us without water refills for a large portion of the unwarranted 2 hour dinner service.  Inexcusable.

When going to a place that charges the prices they do, you expect exemplary standards in all aspects of your dining experience.  From the food, to the service, to something as simple as remembering your order correctly, it takes a lot of small things done well to leave enough of an impression to come back.  Unfortunately, with all things considered, I could honestly say I've had better the last time I went to Olive Garden.

Decor: 4/5
Service: 1/5
Food: 2/5

TL;DR Bad service can make mediocre food taste worse."
777849,"WOW! This place was definitely the highlight of our trip! We came here right after we got off the airplane, around 10:45 PM, and were able to grab seats at the bar right away. 

We ordered the most popular dishes (according to our waiter): sardines, smoked trout and steak tartare. All three were fantastic and we really liked the fact that we could tell that they were made with fresh ingredients.

The atmosphere was very inviting and all the workers were upbeat (even though it was the end of the day). Such a wonderful way to start our trip - I only wish we could have ended our trip here too!"
915673,"This is my to go spot to get my late night grub if I'm ever just got done with a club around Seattle since pretty much nowhere else is open and trust me, I'm not the only one that does that. Around that time, especially on weekends, it's BUSY...I think it closes at 3am, but there would still be a giant crowd of people coming in 15 minutes before closing with no spot to sit since it's so packed, but is still willing to wait and I think the restaurant stays open until everyone is taken care of.

I hear their honey walnut shrimp is good, whatever crowd I end up going to eat with here always order that and it definitely looks good, but I don't eat seafood so I unfortunately wouldn't know! Everything I've ever tried here is good and for a decent price too. 

Thank you Honey Court for opening so late for us people that don't want fast food in the middle of the night!"
1964993,"I was honestly really underwhelmed, and that might be because all the glowing reviews made me think this place was going to be... well, better. 

The pho I ordered was okay. It was regular beef broth with tofu and vegetables. The broth lacked flavor -- I can make better at home, to be honest. The tofu was meh, probably because it couldn't absorb any flavors from the broth. The vegetables and noodles were okay, but like some other users have pointed out, there are better places for pho on the Ave. 

For under $10, I'm just simply okay with the service and product I received. I don't think it was great, and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I don't think I'll be back here, unfortunately."
879193,Food was divine.  I mean it was like taking bites of heaven. The service was also great.  Definitely try this place if you haven't :)
822759,"Good stuff: 
Amazing goat cheese bruschetta 
Delish ossobuchini 
Great service - friendly, attentive without being annoying

Not so great: 
Kinda loud 
Chicken on my husbands meal was rather tough and flavorless 

I would come here again.  I enjoyed the food and the service was great.  They always make sure your water glass is full and check in just enough.  Prices are reasonable.  I can't wait to come when it is a bit warmer and sit out on their patio area."
1480561,Just came home from Mexico and eating here was a real treat. Everything we ordered was amazing.
890453,"Food was really sub par. It lacked seasoning and presentation was worse than Chipotle. The restaurant itself was greasy, not well kept and didn't appeal to my wife or I. My fish tacos weren't executed well and my wife's quesadilla tasted like it came from a microwave. For two tacos a quesadilla and two drinks the bill was 25 bucks. Save your money, you can do better at home."
2167567,"Wow...  not expecting this to be as good as I found it.  Service... GREAT...  food pretty darn good (mine was better than the wife's).

We started off ordering a sampler of wines...  wife got the white wine w/ oyster sampler, and I got the red wine sampler.   4 wines of about 2.5 oz each, and 4 oysters from different waters for her.  Both were a GREAT value for what you got...   appetizer, wise, I got a caprese salad, and the wife got a cup of clam chowder (it was literally a cup...  as in a coffee mug of it).   She liked the clam chowder (not the best she'd ever had... but still pretty good), and my salad was nice...  good mozzerella, nicely ripened tomatoes, and a nice balsamic (good basil too).

On to mains... she had scallops, and I had a NY strip (med rare).   She thought her scallops were a little touch over cooked from her idea of perfection (they looked good to me), and my steak was done BEAUTIFULLY....   taste wise hers was good, but had a lot of distracting tastes worked around (the scallops were served on some sort of meat that she didn't care for), and had a side of scalloped potatoes which she really liked.   My steak was so tasty...  it had ricotta mashed potatoes on the side, and creamed spinach (not a creamed spinach fan... so not much was gonna make that work for me).   The potatoes were great... the steak suberb...

When the offer for dessert came by...  that didn't fly... we were WAY too stuffed!

In the end the bill came and it was a little more than the fairly crappy dinner we had the night before....  so with the quality of the service, the food... the wines...  this was a BARGAIN!

Will definitely come back again next time I'm in Seattle!"
898779,"We got a groupon and decided to try it out - our waiter was so incredibly rude, it was ridiculous! It seemed like he didn't like the fact that we were using a groupon (like he thought we were too poor to eat there without a groupon? He made some kind of nasty comment about it). The food was super weird, but it was OK. I would probably never go back because of that waiter. The only thing that was really good was the margarita, even though I waited for about a half hour to get it and they got the order wrong TWICE."
2154004,"Great food, great customer service, good atmosphere! Try their crunchy roll, it's delish! But the service always takes long for some reason. Therefore, 4 stars it is. Otherwise, no complaints."
1724986,"food is better than a lot of Chinese restaurants in Seattle, but it's not incredible!
the restaurant is ugly and dirty. the chairs are piled in the corners and it just doesnt look nice. THE SERVICE OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Americans like to be treated politely and friendly at restaurants. Im not american but I know this business, HOW THE HECK CAN YOU FAILED SO BAD IN CUSTOMER SERVICE???"
2161095,Came by this place as a recommendation from a local while in Seattle on business. I really enjoyed everything about this restaurant. I used open table to get a reservation and it worked out great because people were waiting outside when I got there. I would definitely come back when I am in Seattle again.
1027955,"These people do it right!! Other restaurants need to learn from these guys! Food is great! Service is so far above great, it's hard to rate on a five star level, more like 10 stars out of 5! Can't say enough good things about them. Every time we go, for happy hour of course, not only do we get prompt service, but they all are very friendly and happy to see you. They go above and beyond what they need to and it seems like they just have a 6th sense for what needs to be done without you even saying anything. They just have you covered, not sure what else to say, GO THERE!!"
1325564,just go! really. just go! don't be stupid. just go. philly in seattle.
1895094,"It's a big deal to give a restaurant 5 stars, but this place deserves it.

The food is exceptional.  The balance of spices and sauces is excellent.  The ingredients are fresh.  The menu is creative.

The wine list is incredible.  Be sure to ask for a recommendation, the sommelier is a wealth of knowledge on the wine right down to the most obscure facts.

They've only been open a couple of months and I've been several times already.  It's fast on the way to becoming my favorite restaurant in Seattle.  Definitely one of the best food establishments in Ballard if you're looking for a proper restaurant.

I hardly think of it as Italian, as Italian food has become so synonymous for me with a list of over priced over sauced dishes that are the same everywhere you go.  You won't get any of this here.

I don't know what the people giving it low reviews are thinking!

Family style, grab some friends, share a few plates, you won't be disappointed."
1350306,"Went here to celebrate a birthday for my dear friend's 30th. Five girls, one table, an hour and a half of food and wine. I'll do my best to recall the evening. We decided to allow the kitchen to serve us with the Do It Fancy option; you basically give them free reign on what they'd like to serve you. Of course the server takes down any dislikes/allergies/etc. 

The BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP was just amazing. I wanted to lick every last drop out of the mini-cup it was served in. My goodness.

Nothing too special about the MIXED BABY LETTUCES, but it did a good job of accompanying  the small CHARCUTERIE PLATE, complete with three different meats to try. 

We were also served two pasta plates, one with a spicy tomato sauce + meat (I believe it was sausage) + bucatini pasta and one wine and butter based + seafood + linguine pasta. We killed both plates with no hesitation. My personal favorite was the red-sauce pasta. Not sure if it was on the regular menu...

We then received two meat based plates, one pork and one fish. I'm also unsure if these two items are on the regular menu, but both were seasoned wonderfully and topped off whatever space we had in our bellies. 

The desserts were amazing too. I just remember salivating to the hazelnut + chocolate dessert... I wish I wrote down the name, or at least the ingredients.

Overall a wonderful dining experience with friendly staff."
842203,"Maybe I'm being a little stingy with 3 stars here, they probably deserve 3.5. I visited for lunch and ate outside on the little terrace.

The food was very good lunchtime fare - I had the Spring Veggies & Red Quinoa salad, which was delicious and healthy. The other people I was with had sandwiches that looked good too. We had Pimms Cups to drink, and although a little on the small side they were very tasty. On food, I'd say 4 stars.

Pegasus loses a point on service, though. The cafe was not particularly busy when we were there (between lunch and dinner times), and seemed well staffed. But we waited....and waited....and waited for our salad and two sandwiches. After more than half an hour I went to ask what was up, the waitress said she'd check on it. 10 minutes later, she comes out to say that it'll be out any second, ""they're just putting the finishing touches on it"". Another 10 minutes and *finally* our food comes. When we were leaving, I overheard another customer go up and say ""We've been here 30 minutes, can I check on our order?"" 

So, just know that speedy service ain't the norm. Maybe that's how it is once you leave the big city? I'd go back for the food, but I'd budget more time into my afternoon for it."
2443684,"We liked that this place stayed open a little later than other restaurants. 

 I was reading on their website about the owner, only to realize that the owner is Yuji Okumoto, who is a film actor from Hollywood, and went to college from around my area. I thought that was pretty cool.

Anyways, the atmosphere is very inviting and Hawaiian. It's laid back and relaxing to be here. Immediately, we were seated and the hostess was very nice and accomodating. 

We ordered the Hawaiian Fried Rice (with medium poached eggs) as well as the Kimchi Fried Rice (with overeasy eggs). I had been craving a poached egg, and it was perfectly cooked with the gooey yolk. The food was so delicious. It was a lot of food, and I had to get a box to go. 

After ten this restaurant turns into a bar and they have free karoake for 21+!"
1086873,It is ok. Fairly good. I think the pictures make it look better than it is. It is as good as Burger King. If you want good burgers go to Burger Express in Federal Way! It is THE BEST and NO ONE can beat them!
805349,"I love Lucky's. Yes, it is about 25% more expensive than other pho places, but what you get is worth it. You can add a ton of yummy, crisp veggies to your pho for $1! That alone keeps me coming back for more. I want my veggies AND my chicken, dammit! And let's not discount the chicken - it's good quality.  No weird veins or gristle here. As it should be."
821104,"Very good! I wouldn't say it's the best tacos I ever had, but they were pretty good, and reasonably priced. We got the house taco, the asada, the chicken, and the pork. I would say the house taco was the best. They had a fair bit if spice to them, which was wonderful, and the lime was very yummy."
1887058,"We had the Mary Mary with tomato sauce added green bell peppers. 

The inside is a mess. Someone has paperwork all over a table. The floors look like they have not been moped in over a year.

The two people in the store front clearly don't get along. Dale is called ""bro"" by the other employee and is talked down to and berated. The other guy, not sure of his name, seems more concerned about the quality of the pizza more then Dale, however could get his point across when customers are not in the store.  (He could also remember to zip up his zipper when coming to work) 

The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. It was pretty salty. The family ate it but we will not be returning.   Next time we are going to Bj's."
1927585,"When  my husband and I arrived in Seattle, the first thing we did was walk to Pike Place and headed straight for Le Panier! There wasn't a line so we went right up and ordered, what seemed like, one of everything. Ok, so we actually only ordered a couple of eclairs, macrons, napoleons and coffee. Hmmm, we may or may not have ordered more than that; but, you, my dear Yelpers, only need to know that whatever we ordered, everything we ordered, the pastries we ordered that could feed a small country but instead just fed two bellies, were superb. To top it all off, they serve Caffe Umbria coffee! You know how your first sip of coffee in the morning is something to be savored? Imagine that, with finally sitting and relaxing after traveling, WITH lovely surroundings, AND the flaky, creamy, goodness that comes with taking a bite into an eclair. Be still my heart, you had me at ""Le Panier"", Seattle!"
1767683,"Heard this was a great sandwich place. NOT. It was closed 3 times i went by on the weekend. Finally stopped by one weekday and the place should be condemmed. Filthy, dirty, area with food stil stuck to their plastic chairs and tables. bags of trash laying around. The sandwich was just the pastrami thrown on a dry roll. Actually the pastrami itself was good but that is it. I'll goto a butcher to get top rate pastrami and avoid this dump."
684597,"Fish House is a great place to have in the neighborhood. So convenient to get lunch here if you work Downtown or at the hospital. Funny I've spent so much time in this neighborhood since I was a kid and never had Fish House till recently.

Well it's one of the few small seafood spots you'll find in Tacoma. Fish filets are huge and taste great. Friendly service. I would like to try more different items in the future.

Only complaints are it's pretty small and parking sucks. But that's not a big deal."
679577,"If you sneeze, you'll miss this place. It's located behind a strip mall. It's front door faces the garbage dumpsters behind the strip mall. No matter, I love this little hole in the wall!  The roasted pork banh mi was delicious!  I agree with other comments about the sandwich bread. It's the perfect texture, not too soft and bready, and not too hard and crusty. The sandwiches come loaded with the pork, shredded carrot and the other ingredients I can't remember. Service is quick and efficient, with a smile. I only wish this place was closer to downtown Seattle."
1640689,"Man, this place is ridiculous:

Juicy, flavorful Katsu-style, deep fried beef hamburger patties. Fries seasoned with nori flakes. And the Mt. Fuji burger - something only a python could get its mouth around.

The food is creative, flavorful and is making my mouth water as I write about it.

My wife and I visited on a lazy Monday afternoon and were blown away by the Godzilla Attack (beef patty, jalepenos, pepperjack cheese, spicy Japanese mayo, and more) and my wife had the Ninja Classic (Katsu-style pork cutlet, cheddar cheese, bacon, and more). And yes - the fries and dipping sauces are as good as advertised. 

The burgers are huge, delicious, oh man. I can't wait to return."
807894,"Excellent food, service, and prices! I went here with a party of 10 and all of us loved what we had to eat. The service was friendly and attentive and the night ended beautifully when our server eagerly offered to split our bill for us 10 ways! Wonderful restaurant and I will definitely be coming back!"
1494831,"Although I don't live in Bothell, I would be willing to hop on a bus and enjoy another wonderful breakfast there. I ordered the Venetian Scramble which came with a copious amount of tomatoes and a healthy amount of garlic cooked within the eggs. The portions of the scramble and the side of home potatoes were more than enough. My guest enjoyed the breakfast burrito that was also just a filling. The waitstaff were polite and the food was served quickly."
2126913,"I came to Pink Door to take my boyfriend out for his birthday, I made a reservation they gave us this perfect little table for to to watch the acrobat/dance show and it was perfect! 
The atmosphere is very romantic and charming, I loved it! It is very reasonable on pricing as well, with a restaurant like this in downtown Seattle you can't go wrong!"
163023,"A couple good friends of ours live right off Alki, just a block or two up from Phoenecia, and they had been raving about this place for months. They promised it would be worth the drive out to West Seattle. We finally made it over there for dinner at Phoenicia, and all I can is I wish we'd done it sooner!

The pizza was unexpectedly stupendous. We all got a different pizza for dinner and there wasn't a dud in the bunch. My favorite was off the specials board - I can't remember the exact ingredients now, but I do recall that it combined salty meat with sweet figs - an excellent and surprising combo. The Alki with spicy salami, caramelized onions, kalamata olives and a medley of cheese was also mouth-wateringly delicious.  I would encourage you to branch out and try something a little different rather than just getting a basic margarita or pepperoni pizza - you might be surprised!

We didn't even get to the tapas menu, with the exception of the 39 Spice Beef... it packs a punch! Tons of flavor and tender meat, great for sharing as an appetizer. Prices are in the mid-range but certainly justified given the quality of the food. Love the focus on local, sustainable ingredients.

This a really a neighborhood gem. Great spot for a date or dinner with friends. The front windows offer a gorgeous view of the sunset behind the Olympics... but go early if you want to snag a window table (or hope you get lucky!)."
2161999,"Tasty vegan chowder! I'm vegan so other then the vegan chowder I can't really say anything. 

One word of advice, don't buy a salad and try to add shrimp...apparently that is confusing and you end up getting charged like $20.00."
2165054,"The first time my husband and I ventured into Barrio for dinner we both agreed that we received the best service of our lives! Things were replenished before we knew we needed them, the food was amazing, the surroundings beautiful, and the service was friendly. All this during a very busy dinner rush! We were blown away!! Since then, we have returned twice and have truly enjoyed everything we've had. What a great addition to Capital Hill!"
2476386,"Always have to come here first when I come visit Seattle. Absolutely love everything about this place! Always get a chocolate martini when I'm there and it's so decadent!  Staff is friendly and professional, this will continue to be a regular stop for me when I'm in Seattle!"
811049,"I was in town on business and a local suggested that I try it out. I sat in the bar area and liked the decor and open windows to people watch. I sampled several of the local beers (at the bartenders suggestion) and finally decided. Ordered the 8oz sirlion steak! Was DELICIOUS!  

Make sure you get a side of the Mac and Cheese.  Can't go wrong!!

I would definently go back!"
1764602,"I have lived in tacoma off and on for my whole life and seattle otherwise. I have a gluten intolerance and its very difficult to eat out in tacoma. In seattle i not only had endless options, I had many options for delivery. I recently visited amerawcan bistro and I loved it!! But unfortunately because of my demanding work schedule and Amerawcan Bistros hours of business I can't make it in as much. If they delivered  I would give them a 6 out of 5 !!!!"
888406,"I love Ethan Stowell restaurants. When my parents visited I made reservations here because they really like seafood - I was not disappointed! We ordered a smattering of crudo dishes, appetizers, pasta, and entrees and every single one was our favorite. The service was great and the waiter knew a ton about the different wines they had.

I haven't been in Seattle long - about a year and a half now - but this is by far my favorite (expensive) restaurant!"
2611466,"The food is great, the service was stellar, drink selection is awesome! I love the ambiance and decor. I had the reuben and it was perfect. Thanks for being great, and for being open 24 hours on the hill!"
1338866,Zen And The Art Of Depreciation. Selling old CDs to Easy Street is quick and painless. They seem to pay about as much as Half Priced Books. But they are more picky. Probably because Easy Street has more inventory and a narrower demographic. But man it's sad seeing them pay $3 for that $32 Kiss Alive II double CD set purchased in 1991.  The only way to make more $ is sell on eBay but it's labor-intensive. So Easy Street is the easy way to sell $300 of CDs for the preset value of a six pack of Anchor Steam. Damn ITunes!
106348,"This place reminded me a little bit of a dark, swanky cool library...but with delicious food and tasty drinks. 

You MUST get the burger with pork belly. I was afraid it'll be overkill (beef & pork belly whaaaa??)  but this burger was omg good. The pork belly was just melt in your mouth delicious. The provolone cheese was nice touch. Yes, the $19 price tag is high but my tastebuds would certainly say its justified. I would happily order this again.

Other items we got was the Mac and cheese & spiced fried chicken. The Mac and cheese was flavorful, another repeat order I would get in the future. The spiced chicken was good but not as great as the burger or Mac-n-cheese. It was a little on the sweet side.

I wanted to try a sweet & fruity drink and the waiter recommended The Lusty Lady. I don't remember what was in it but it was perfect for me. I'm excited to come back and try the other drinks they offer (extensive list) and perhaps try the speakeasy bar above it."
2647630,"Des Moines is a restaurant wasteland so I feel bad for not wanting to rave about the Scotch and Vine. Overpriced pours of wine and a $14.00 cheeseburger that was cooked properly but had no flavor has been on my mind for months. Also the obnoxious names on the menu added to the cheesy factor that I try to avoid.  Dear Des Moines restaurant guild,  Please give us locals a place to be proud of.

#hopeless."
2166327,"Really love these guys and their food - really good and accessible locavore in a cute location.  Food and Wine are the standout here, the room could use better lighting near the fireplace and a velvet curtain over the entrance to keep wind from blowing into the room when folks arrive."
953333,"Ok food, but really slow/forgetful service from Nikki. I had to go to the bar to get my drink because the server forgot. She also forgot our food.  I saw it sitting on the service window for 10 minutes, and I had to remind her to get them. Ice cold by the time she did.

What really pissed me off about the server was the way she blamed the kitchen for her mistake.  She said there was a new cook, which is why the fries were cold.  I told her that I saw the fries sitting in the window for ten minutes.  Then she walked away.

Once the food finally came out, and replacement warm fries were served, I'll admit that it was pretty tasty, even if presentation was lacking.

If it wasn't for the horrible service, I would give this place 4 stars."
1676283,"AMAZING food. My husband gets the prime rib with the twice-baked potato and I get the bacon wrapped fillet mignon with the fries, we both get a Caesar salad, and then we share a cheesecake for dessert. Wonderful quality, taste, and portions. Some of the best cheesecake we've ever had. This last time we went, it was so busy that we had to wait an hour, but it was DEF worth it. The first time we went, our server was awesome! This second time though, our server was really nice, but not there too much. I'm sure that had to do with how busy it was, but still, more attentiveness would have been nice."
1655138,"Happened to take a friend who is vegan to Blue C Sushi. Impressed by  ""vegan""/  ""gluten free"" information card attached to each sushi plate.  Friendly sushi chef. We enjoyed our lunch there. Service is ok not great. There were only two servers over about 20 people there. Although it's kind of self-served through the conveying belt, still a bit of wait to get drinks and the bill."
1324006,"Sports bar located right next to the Space Needle and Glass Museum. Full gluten free menu with lots of options so any Celiacs on vacation visiting the Needle should definitely plan a meal at this place. 

It's huge and was basically empty for lunch on a weekday, despite being located inside of some office building (the bathrooms are in said office building and you need a passcode from your server). Standard pub fare that was nothing special, but it's definitely better than overpaying for some stale sandwich at the top of the needle."
1686106,"We went last week and the service was absolutely horrible. There were over 20 customers, one waitress and one chef so the service was extremely slow. There was an older couple who came in to the restaurant and shuffled around behind the counter for a bit then quickly left. I assume they could have been the owners. If they were, they should have rolled up their sleeves and helped their employees. Instead they left the workers to struggle to scrape up some sort of customer satisfaction. After 10 minutes, the waitress finally came to our table and her greeting was ""OK"" and she held out her paper to write down our order. This was the last time she came to our table except to bring the bill. seriously, one word was all we got. I had to get up to find myself some water and ask the chef for more wasabi. 

There were three large groups that came in and were left to stand at the front without any regard from the hostess/waitress/busser. Most of them left in disgust. There was a sign in the front saying there was no alcohol that day. That would have been tolerable if the service wasn't so painfully slow. The sushi Chef knew his stuff but we won't be going back.

I've been here once before and it was staffed adequately. The service was not great then either. Someone's cutting too many corners and I'm thinking this place might not be around much longer."
187442,"Me and my lady tried this place out the other night because she gave up eating meat for Lent and, well to quote Jules from Pulp Fiction: ""...because my girlfriend's a vegetarian which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.""

I ordered the ""Crab"" Cake burger. It actually did taste exactly like a crab cake, and actually really good so I was happy with it. Got a side of sweet potato fries and a Rootbeer (which was reallly good)

She ordered the Crispy Chikin plate...I guess she liked it but I couldn't really get over the fake chicken, I don't know what it is w/ fake meat but I can't get used to it...it's like they overcompensate w/ herbs and it just tastes funny to me. But hey, whatever floats your boat.

The restaurant itself had modern decor and had a pretty cool vibe. I'd come back, but probably only for the ""Crab"" Cake again."
1648552,"Ohhh, I want to love this place (being a veggie myself and all), but I just wasn't impressed. The menu is decent, the cafe itself is cute, the staff are nice.  The food is just mediocre -- I can easily make better food at home -- that's my test.  

I visited on a decently busy day, we had quick service, got our drinks, placed our orders, had a very nice waiter.  The prices are good too.  The food was just not.  I had a breakfast burrito with both red/ green sauces, black beans and potatoes.  None of the items rocked my socks.  The beans reminded me of something directly out of a can (think the Cuban seasoned beans or something).  It reminded me of food made at home, which is OK.  But for me, I go out to eat to get things I can't make at home, or that are too time consuming.  My husband (not a crazy chef) makes black beans that would put these to shame.

Again, I wanted to love this spot, but my food (and my friend's), were both just meh.  I'm a vegetarian, I want people to go to veggie spots that rock your socks and make you question why the heck you're eating meat at all (why put the animal and our environment through all that hell for something so unnecessary, when there's so much good vegetarian and vegan food out there).  This isn't a spot I'd tell friends to visit."
1285471,"Pros:
Nice staff, but with a whiff of entitlement conflicting with gratitude for having a job.
Great location but ALMOST NO PARKING nearby.
Sides of bacon are excellent, with good-sized portions
Not too noisy.
Greasy spoon meets Whole Foods, but in a good way.
Not too expensive for what you get.
Pleasingly-few hipster ""I'm cool enough to eat here--are you?"" clientele.

Cons:
Berry Bar (toppings etc) kinda crowded and overrated
Long lines out the door and waiting in the rain. Wait line breathing down our necks as we ate our meal.
Poor hours: needs to open before 7AM to catch the before-school and I-have-a-Life crowds.
Rude and impertinent slogan in yer face: ""Eat like you give a damn"" Really?
Coffee fit for degreasing engine blocks.

I ordered the GF Swedish pancakes--very yummy but ultimately indigestible.

Second attempt to visit we were driven off by the long waiting-line; didn't even stop. We went to Chinook's instead. I can't imagine the crowds-to-be once those hundreds of new apartments in Ballard are fully occupied."
122941,"I threw a surprise for my boyfriend's 27th birthday. The restaurant itself was a little difficult to find..(I'm horrible with directions as is), but there's nothing but a light pink door that can be easily passed by.
I glanced at the menu online before coming to prepare for the impending monetary  damage... it wasn't as BAD as I thought as I thought it was going to be... but I spent a little over $100 for a bottle of red vino, the cheese plate, 2 entrees, and a dessert.

The wine -good.
The cheese plate- could be better. (I recall the cheese plate at local vine to be suuuuperb)
Arugula beet salad- too much gorgonzola cheese- it killed the rest of the salad.. and I wish it had more roasted beets.
bolognese- DELISH! Not too spicy, or meaty, or noodle-y.
dessert: Bongo Bongo (Choux pastry filled with a sweet cream drizzled with chocolate.)

The trapeze artist was good entertainment, our server was gracious and patient.

I think My BF and I will come here again, but I'll try something else on the menu....."
813463,"On a Saturday, my friend and I made a trip out here for breakfast, saw the line, turned around and left, vowing to get up early the next day and to come right at 7:30 when they open.

Boy were we surprised when we got there at 7:25 and there were already 20 people waiting for the doors to open. After a brief wait in line, we ordered and paid. I ordered a maple pastry, a Greek frittata, and coffee; my friend ordered a cinnamon roll and the blueberry French toast.

The order staff was friendly and for a place that does not have table service, it was nice that a staff member was going through the line to arrange seating for people, as opposed to the cluster**** seen at many similar businesses. We sat outside and I drank my coffee as we waited. I drink my coffee black and found it to be a little more acidic than I prefer but at that time of day I need the caffeine and sucked back three cups.

It took our food longer than I would have thought, but it was nice for a staff member to bring it to us as the line to order steadily grew longer and longer.

My frittata hit the spot and was quite fluffy and not too oily. A perfect amount of olives, spinach, tomatoes, and feta. I tried a bite of blueberry french toast and it was amazing. My maple bar pastry was also quite decadent and offset the saltiness of the fritatta wonderfully. NOTE: Dipping it in coffee is an almost sexual experience.

We both found the potatoes to be undercooked, which seems to be a theme for this place. Hopefully they fix that as there is no excuse not to cook potatoes well. 

All in all, this places charm seems to balance out the wait and demand. Would I personally stand in line for an hour to get my order? No. Would I wake up early to beat the crowd? Yes. It seems like the majority of negative reviews stem from people who dislike long lines or the lack of a focus on table service. These individuals likely did not educate themselves about this business or have magical expectations that all businesses adopt whatever service model that the complaining reviewer expects when writing about their experience.

Definitely consider Chaps. I have been to probably 30 - 40 restaurants that have been featured on DDD, and Chaps is among the top 10 of those that I have visited and I tend to have high expectations for hyped up businesses."
209951,"Faith has been restored folks! 

I placed a larger order TO GO a few months ago, and it was bit of a mess. 
My order was wrong, and I stood in line for over 10 minutes to pay, only to see that my food had been just sitting on the counter, by the time that my food would have gotten home, it would have been sitting for almost an hour, and that's not ok. To go orders should stay in a warmer, that is the safest. 

The manager gave me a few cards for chicken wings, while they fixed my order that night, because everything was all out of order, and messed up. 

I used one of those cards yesterday on 8/29/12 at lunch time, and the person who took my order was very friendly, and funny. When I got there though, they did not make me feel good about using my free card. They were not very friendly, and they wanted to charge me extra for ranch, when I know that at least one comes with the wings. Funny thing was that the rude person was the same one to mess up my order in the first place, the whole reason why I even had a free card; he has no patience, and is not good with customers. 

I decided to use my last card today 8/30/12,  just to get it out of the way, and to just not go back again. Today was an awesome visit though. I had my friends daughter with us, and this one server really connected with both of us, she was being very helpful with our order, and helping us decide what to get. She was eager to help us, and make our visit pleasant even though she was not even on the clock. The other computers were being used, and as soon as she clocked in she took us to another computer so that she could take our order, she gave us OUTSTANDING customers service. 

So even though our visits have been hit and miss, I'm glad that today's went so well, because I almost stopped coming, but I will be giving this place more chances in the future. The coolest thing, was that there was a special on the wings today, and so I got the special instead of using my free card, so I still have at least one more time to go in, and hopefully that visit will go just as well as today!"
810424,Previous reviewers must be going to some other place. The food quality is roughly at or slightly below an Azteca type offering. The service was prompt and pleasant but the food really leaves a lot to be desired.
951440,Yummy breakfast! Love the cozy diner atmosphere and Olympia charm! Had tasty eggs Benedict. You'll enjoy the old arcade games and good music playing in the background
760443,Not impressed... I will be trying somewhere else next time.
1797541,"Don't you love a  r e a l  breakfast place: good food, good atmosphere, sunshine (Seattle-important). This place makes me happy ..."
1102737,"Went here for a birthday dinner & I regret even showing up. It was expensive & not great...at all. I don't remember what type of dinner package we got, but it was a set price for each person. We did got a lot of food, but it was still like 30 bucks before tax & tip for each person for average tasting food and normal dishes such as a Caesar salad. On top of that, we felt being rushed the whole time to finish up & get out. Maybe we just all look so young so the server's assumption was that he wasn't going to get a good tip out of us."
792482,I am a fan of Thai and Burmese flavors.  I hit the jackpot ordering the Laksa and the mango mojito!  The blend of flavors in each was complex and perfectly balanced!  I'm not a whiskey drinker but enjoyed the flavors in the oo-la-la.  Dim lighting.  Comfortable place.  Wish I could stay in Seattle longer to try the rest of the menu.
2144029,OMG!  We LOVE Paseo.  Never in my life would I have believed that waiting in the rain in line for a sandwich would be worth it.  It so was!  I'd stand in the rain all day for one of these delicious Paseo bundles of joy!
1962151,"These Burgers are just the Best In the Seattle area, I had never gone there and leave unsatisfied... they always delivery Amazing food and excellent Service"
1660690,"We love this place! We live in Bellevue and we happened to run into this restaurant on our way to a friend's holiday party and sure glad we found it!
The first visit we sat at the bar, the bartender is excellent and very attentive, well now with our second visit the whole staff is attentive and polite.  Must try their specialty drink ""Bangkok Firecracker"" one of a kind with a kick at the end of every sip. The food is very good, we love the lamb satay with their yummy peanut sauce. The owner is around greeting the customers at their table making sure everything is OK. We really enjoy this place, definitely worth the drive!"
1118792,"We had lunch today at the Crab Pot in Seattle and really enjoyed the service and our meal!  I had the Crab Louie Salad and it was delicious and loaded with crab....Don had a fried oyster por boy sandwiche....he said it was delicious...not my type of food so I didn't bother to steal a bite!!!  The place was busy it is right on the water on the Seattle water edge.  The service was terrific and they all seemed happy to be there, which seems to be unusual for servers these days!!! I highly recommend the place and would go back"

1625285,This place has great pizza and wonderful beer. What more could a lady want?
1727035,"Joined a walking group and met here for an exploration of the Lake City neighborhood. Good coffee but the German-centric pastries are the star. The owner was there rolling out dough in the kitchen so the pastries are lovingly made, not the mass produced stuff from the big chain coffee companies. The Blondie I ate was delicious. There is a huge variety of sweets and the space is good for meeting up. I was told the owners participate in enriching the local community in which they live. Glad I discovered this place."
941590,"Good French food at a very reasonable price. Nice selection of wonderful pastries.  We went on a Saturday about 1 PM, which was a mistake. The order line was confused. I had to put in two separate orders, because the order-taker didn't wait to hear our  entire order. The baguette used for my sandwich was too hard, but otherwise the food quality was very good.  I may go back, but next time I'll try to go when they're not crazy-busy."
924320,Ordered a little bit of everything. Loved the egg plant but the ricotta squash blossoms were so good. Dinner I got a pork chop that was thick and juicy. I really liked the Kolarabi side dish. Did not care for the cold soup. I had no problem with the amour of seasoning like others had mentioned but that did have me worried. Drinks were worth 10.00 got the lemon drop and others who were with me ordered the knockers up and said they were just as good as mine. Dessert we got a sample player and I really think all of the tray was to die for delicious. We hope to go out again to visit.
408946,"I've been here MANY times in the past and have been a big fan, but this was my first visit back in about a year. Booth seats are cracking & table service nonexistent, even though i saw waitstaff walking right by me & hanging out with each other chatting. Owner was busy restocking. Not a ""hello"" from anyone!

But bartender was nice when i went up to order. I had to walk up for the second one too, waitstaff didn't notice empty glass. Maybe I was in invisibility mode? At least their steak salad is goooooood, and the bartender had some great recommendations for hoppy IPAs."
852436,"Wow! The Pina Colada was outstanding. LOVE it! We went at closing time. The bartender was very accommodating, even to the point of getting the grills going again to make our scrumptious nachos. I love the mixed drinks and all of my friends were impressed with the drinks. I was expecting quality equivalent to red robin or other chain restaurants. But, no, they truly did a fabulous job. Will definitely go back. BTW we were a little bummed the music went from dance to sad/slow. No problem, the bartender went and changed the station just like that and we were back to having fun in no time. Thanks for the great experience. BTW my friends had something called a ""Bam Bam"" where its a boat shaped cup bigger than a football and the drink that was in it was sooooooo good. All that alcohol was only 9.99 for it! My Pina Colada wasnt much either. So pricing with the taste, its a 10. Oh, the Nachos were bomb as well."
852832,Overall a very good experience.  Wait staff was quite prompt and checked in often and the food for all of us was very good.  My wife even said she thought the Mussels were some of the best she's ever had.  We'll go back.
1915625,"I want to give it a 4.5 if I could... it's not quite a all fave 5 star location yet in my book for myself, but that won't mean I won't be back in the neat future either.

I love the location because I live right down the block, so winning on that!

The menu is short and sweet, with a lot of options for all. It is a little hard to read, but it is part of what makes it ""Art House"" I guess. Just line, after line with little spacing in between, but thankfully for everyone involved pretty much everything on it is delicious.

The service has always been good enough. Sometimes I felt like we were waiting on this or that or the other, which is silly because it is so small that it's not that hard to do a drive by, but sometimes being left alone is nice, so once again I am not really complaining.

Once we were in when they were playing some live music, with a man on the guitar who sang as well. He was pretty good and it was a nice surprise.

I have only been in a half dozen times for late evening dinners and am looking forward to trying it for breakfast sometime. Who knows maybe it will turn into a five star review. I do think it would have to be pretty bad to knock it down to three.

Overall, a solid selection for a nice quiet intimate meal. I would definitely take any friend there."
1204315,"When I worked at a (very shitty) job in Pioneer Square, this unassuming little cafe was all that got me through the day sometimes. Everyone there is so nice! And they make the food so quick, so people with tiny lunch breaks can relax and enjoy it in peace for a while.

I almost always order the tofu banh mi with rice and beans. The tofu marinade is on the sweeter side, which is okay with me, and the servings are huge. 
I've also tried their raspberry bars and the Nutella mocha. 
Everything is solidly good every time, inexpensive, and really filling. 
I love Mimosa Cafe and I go out of my way to get lunch from them every once in a while, now that I no longer work in Pioneer Square. Man, that was a terrible job. Thanks, Mimosa Cafe, for brightening my day every time I've visited."
790153,"I give it 5 stars because it's as good as I've seen! They have the freshest fish, biggest and tastiest rainbow roll, delicious spicy tuna bowl, and very reasonable prices! Get in early or get left out - the place is small and gets packed even on weekdays."
1816584,"Meh... I wanted to love it, but I didn't. Maybe if I wasn't facing the weird paintings of the young women?   Others have commented on the outdated decor, but it's  just those paintings!  They have to go!   
The Mac n cheese was delish, the prawns were yummy, the rosemary flatbread was perfectly salty. The drinks were just a bit above okay.  I'd give it another try, but next time I'm going to avoid looking at the cartoon paintings of 18 year olds (weird!)."
619249,"Attention: I have never been to this restaurant before 9pm.

This is a 24-Hour restaurant so I use it as a late night/after hours haunt. Definitely the place to so if you are craving Penn Cove mussels and hashbrowns at 2AM. This place has a warm and intoxicating ambiance. All the seating choices are awesome, either a large, engrossing leathery booth or high-back stools at the bar. The stools are great because they wrap around you a studded-leather hotdog bun - makes me want to spin abound and look at people fiendishly while stroking a white cat. Legend has it that in the 90's (and before) when journalism was a prized, and respected, commodity; the newsmen and women of Seattle would flock here at night and fill the booths with local celebrity.

I always have liked the service I've received. Every once in a while you'll get a very personable server, and that is always nice. The manager comes around and checks on guests from time to time which gives that sense of old timey class. As a nice surprise, a few months ago I went in with a buddy to drink scotch and have a nice conversation...when we went into the bar/lounge (""Night Owl Lounge"" or something) there was a band set up - I guess they do that weekly (Fridays?). I've heard music there twice and both times it was really nice and laid back; a Stevie Knicks type lady (requested ""Leather and Lace"" - to which she obliged) and a Soft Hawaiian (mostly acoustic) set that did a fantastic version of ""Hotel California"".

Of course the food is good, some pastas but mostely grilled food. It's the sort of place that makes you want red meat and scotch (or a oaky red wine) - and just be a little gluttonous/lustful and politically incorrect. I bet this place took a big hit when Seattle banned smoking and waitresses started demandin respect in their workplace.

This place is not a 5 because isn't unique or even inventive - just a good fashion mainstay of yesteryear. Most of the food is good, some things just slightly better than OK, but nothing life altering. But if you want to relax and melt a bit - 13 Coins, my friend."
1121884,"if you read my initial tip - my advice is to ignore the snotty hostess and focus on the food! our waitress was nice and attentive, so that made up for snoots, big-time.

we ordered the coq au vin, haricots verts, and duck confit. all prepared well and full of flavor. the coq au vin was tender chicken in a delicious red wine sauce over spaetzle (pasta). the spaetzle was the only jarring note - being a bit on the gummy side. the haricots verts (green beans) were in a class of their own, being rich with lemon and fresh garlic! the duck confit was also very tender and juicy- my personal peeve is the greasy tendency of duck is a turnoff, but my dinner companion found everything to her liking. 

we closed out with a Creme brÃ»lÃ©e that was passable. it was probably cooked at some point today and refrigerated before the blowtorch action. cold in the middle and grainy in texture...pass on this one...

so call in your reservation, ignore snoots and enjoy some incredibly delicious French- inspired cooking!"
1803556,"Great healthy option. 
I tried the Hercules, and was happy with the choice.
Looking forward to trying their other options.

They may have underestimated their popularity. 
A little bit of a wait, but it was worth it."
1676486,"Small establishment that works really hard to give you a bang for your buck.  Wonderful burgers, gyros, breakfasts.  Sweet Greek family that aims to please."
1459766,"This place doesn't suck. We had the pickled vegetables, anchovalade, clams and sausage with mushrooms (it had a fancier name then that but I don't recall what it is). 

Their cocktails are delicious. 

The atmosphere is wonderful."
2583597,"Go for the drinks, the bartender DAVID!!  He is one of the two reasons I go.  (the other reason is the Tiramisu & Panna Cotta dessert).  All the awesome waitress has left, but DAVID is still there and love his awesome drinks and the total zen energy!  After work chefs go there, that should tell you something.

The bartender David is gone - so, 4 star to 2 star."
891840,Their banh mi is outstanding.
868252,"Favorite pizza place! Perfect crust and tasty toppings. Salads are amazing too. I love making my own creation with fresh spinach, caramelized onions, goat cheese, artichoke hearts and Mama Lil's Peppers. The Seward Park location is just as good. Yum!"
872909,"Great service, amazing food. We tried several dishes and loved them all! We will definitely be back again to try something else on the menu because it was so hard to choose. Save room for dessert, they have a delicious dessert menu!"
907950,"A delicious, flavorful, meat packed (or veggie if you like) gyro.  This place is the king of gyros.  Visiting Aladdins with friends is the perfect social outing for me because you can't visit them without being exposed to the whole cutlure behind the Ave.  With that said, cash only?  Please fix the ATM."
2161312,"Brunch or dinner, it's a win win! A great brunch menu that includes a fantastic French Toast with calvados, apples and hazelnuts, a wonderful baked eggs dish and even a perfect Bastille burger. For dinner you can't beat the traditional French fare done perfectly. Teh mussels steak frites and roasted chicken are musts. Dine in the back bar for a little more casual feel or fireside to chat with your neighbor. Great cocktails and a friendly wine list."
1440718,"Loved this place. Great food and great happy hour choices!!! Had the Margarita pizza and for dessert had the gingerbread waffle. Prices range from $10 - $40 so best time you should visit is during Happy Hour. Also bring a coat, its really cold inside."
759320,"I love this place! The atmosphere, music, and food are phenomenal! Everything on the menu is wonderful in my mouth. One of my favorite go to items on the menu is the Fried chicken gumbo. I have a strict diet but I have absolutely no guilt when I break it to eat here. The cajun bloody mary is the best in flavor that I have had anywhere in Seattle or ever for that matter. This place is always busy but don't get discouraged and it's totally worth the wait. I'm almost hesitant to write this review because I don't want to add to the wait ;). 
Lastly, the service is not exactly on par with other excellent aspects mentioned above. The service is inconsistent and not super attentive unless you're at the bar. There is one bartender that is not friendly and has attitude but all the others are really great. All in all, the service is a 3 out of 5 and not bad enough to bring down the good qualities of this restaurant. Worth it still. 
Cheers and happy eating, for sure!"
958262,"Happy hour is a must! I didn't know that they had one and made dinner reservations, but we mostly ordered off the happy hour menu (clams, pork buns, $1 oysters!, caramel corn). I must not have chosen my cocktails well though, wasn't super excited about them, but they were pretty good regardless. Recommended."
2779368,This is one of my absolute favorite burger place in town. First let me say I love burgers. They are my favorite food and I would marry one if I could. That is not acceptable though so I will just eat them. This is a good place to go and I've been going since I was a kid. They are yummy and quick to get out and you can get waited on in your car. Love it!
1969124,Great atmosphere and food is authentic.  Love this place.
2163643,Best Pho in Seattle!!!
1746059,Great service and bar! Had great burgers and bloody Mary's. A little off the beaten path but worth the extra step!
218320,"Yes, $38 fried chicken and it is worth every penny.  When the breast is as tender as the thigh, you know this is good fried chicken.  I would even venture to say the best fried chicken in Seattle.  The clams with bread for dipping is a must as well.  Skip the overpriced spam musabi (why is it called spiced ham?), skip the curry fried rice (way too salty), order another chicken if you have to.

Whiskey is kind of overpriced too, stick to the trendy beer and pretend to blend in as a hipster."
880812,"Best coffee you'll find on the East Side. Friendliest baristas, best sandwiches, perfect cups of coffee and WAFFLES!!!"
859307,"What an amazing meal!  The food was impeccable.  We got the cheese plate (5 phenomenal choices) and the prosciutto to start.  I had the rotisserie chicken and it was incredible.  The chicken was moist; the greens were perfectly seasoned and the mashed potatoes were like butter.  Everyone was wild about their meals and we could not have a conversation because after each bite you had to say ""this is so good.""  A few of my friends ordered dessert and raved about them too.

The staff was incredibly friendly and kept coming over and checking on us. The kitchen is open and in the middle of the restaurant so we made sure to let the chef and his staff know how amazing the meal was.  

A laid back atmosphere with the most fantastic food.  The bill was not that expensive considering we had two appetizers, a couple of drinks each and a few desserts.  What a star in the Seattle dining scene"
1702714,Old school greasy pancake and eggs place. It's a place you should go if you want to get a feel for what Bellevue used to be like before all the software money showed up.  They don't have any vegetable according to the waitress last time I was there. :)
1916197,"We absolutely love Billy Beach sushi.  The food quality is excellent, and it doesn't hurt that it's near my house in Ballard.  

The ambience is decent.  I could see some booths in there to make it a tad more comfortabl, but overall we'll keep going back for the fish.

Get the Yellowtail Belly nigiri.  Most of the time the chef cuts it so beautifully that it's as delightful to look at as it is to eat.

My favorite sushi in Ballard for sure."
2627345,Louisa's Cafe & Bakery is amazing!  We have taken out of town guests here and driven from North Seattle just to have some of their blackberry cobbler during the summer months.  Lauren was our server last  time we were in and she's amazing!  Their service is great and I recommend trying the biscuits!
908791,Awesome dinner and great service. The pairings both the wine and non-alcoholic were very appropriate.
2407027,"This place is kind of a dump. I really love it. Great beer, good food, and the odd clientele make for great people watching."
881994,"The place is nice. But unless you want to pay 30 dollars for a dish that tastes like frozen italian gp somewhere else.
Also they forced a 20% tip. Omg"
909259,"Sad, this place only has 3.5 stars?  We had a blast coming here.  Family was in town so we took them to the Ballard Loft.  It is situated in the cute Ballard downtown area.  Strolling around this area is so nice.  When we arrived, it was very busy because a game was in session.  Everyone there was concentrated on watching the tv screen.  Even though the place was bustling, our waitress was still very attentive and pleasant.  She took our orders and gave us great tips on what to order.  My hubby had the steak cheese sandwich (REALLY GOOD), I had the chopped salad with bacon, eggs, and chicken added on top (a normal salad but large portions), and other people got the sliders (ok).  They gave generous portions.  We also ordered a pitcher of local beer.  For our appetizer, we ordered the nachos, which was pretty tasty.  The best part of coming here was that I have a livingsocial.  In total, we spent about $60 including tip and tax for four people.  We were all pleasantly fed.  :)"
1344483,"They didn't have the pasta I had downtown but the service here is top of the line. Wife and I decided to commit a Friday ""date night"" here based on how much we enjoyed the downtown location and admittedly, we weren't disappointed. 
We were not as ""wowed"" as our first experience but it wouldn't be fair to rate this less then 4 stars. Had the basil pesto pasta and wife had the prawns. After having clams as an appetizer, she admitted the sauce was a little rich and was dominating her palate. 
The pesto pasta was good but had large pieces of sun dried tomato that would have been better served chopped up. The pesto was fine but so fresh that I detected some earthy notes. More of just a a surprise to my palate then a negative. 
In summary, I'm not sure that we'll ever go back but this is definitely fine dining on the east side and the servers do such a good job that even in spite of a less then stellar food offerings, I would still recommend it. 
Not to mention that their bread and butter is the wine and they have a nice selection. They also partner with their neighbors ""Lot No. 3"" and serve a dizzying array of cocktails, including 10 different kinds of Manhattans!"
2606841,"By the freshest, tastiest, cleanest hot-pot spot in I.D.

I think it's a little more expensive than some of the other hot pot places; but for a good reason.  The meat is fresher and the ingredients are at a higher quality.  Everything taste fresh.

They don't offer as many types of meats and veggies as, the other places, that is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me."
803594,Went there on 6/5/13 at 5PM - just right when they were opening for dinner. There was only one couple seated and we were the only other people (2 kids and wife and I). We were seated and given water. 15 minutes have passed and no one came to even see if we were ready to order which we were because we weren't even looking at our menu anymore. A few more people were seated and it seemed like they got more attention than we did. So we decided to just head out and as we were walking out no one even stopped us - especially the person who seated us - didn't even say a word - just looked at us walking away...Never going there - EVER! Place sucks!
989282,"Went this evening and got a slab of ribs for takeout. Excellent, meaty ribs, not fatty.The sauce is a bit sweet and not spicy. I liked it just fine, but for those who want something else I do't' think they have options for sauces. The owner/cook is the nicest guy! I will be back soon for lunch to try other things (even though I have lots of leftovers in the fridge)"
2139575,Very lovely ambiance. Their Moscow Muller is delicious! I'm so happy I discovered this restaurant.
1954027,"Eh.  I was starving and unfortunately forced to eat here by my crew.  At fest I was excited to see a French restaurant.  I actually really like French food. but this place didn't seem like a restaurant so much as a place to get charcuterie...  which to me does not a meal make.  Basically there was no other type of meat available.  I would probably have just gotten a coffee here if I hadn't been so darn hungry.  the worst part is, after stuffing myself with butter, bread and fat, I still felt hungry"
1475395,"My wife and I tried the Tossed Salad, 50 North Burger, and Spicy Chicken Sandwich for dinner one night.  It was ok.

The tossed salad lacked flavor, and the vinaigrette was a little oily for my liking.

The 50 North Burger was pretty well-made.  I asked for it cooked medium, and it was cooked medium - this is something I appreciate, since most burger places don't get it right.  The flavors all went well together, so I found it to be an enjoyable burger.  The fries, however, weren't impressive - I couldn't get over how soggy they were.  And to have thin fries that are soggy makes them so much harder to eat.

The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was less impressive than the burger, mainly because it wasn't all that spicy, and I wasn't a fan of the sriracha aioli.  Sriracha is great by itself, but when cream-ified, tastes strange, and obviously takes away from the spiciness.  The chicken was pretty decently-cooked, though - not too dry.  Same soggy fries.

It's a nice restaurant, good environment, friendly staff.  The food just wasn't super impressive."
1084745,"I would definitely give the food four stars, but the service is horrible.  On several occasions we have gone in to have dinner, and have received the rudest and most inhospitable service from the woman who has been working the counter.

There was a different woman who worked there (not sure if she was an owner or manager), but she was fantastic and super friendly. She recently had a baby, so she isn't working the restaurant right now. This new woman who took her place is simply awful.

The first time, we thought she as just a little gruff. She had sort of snapped at us when we didn't order our food properly.  I guess there is list of steps you have to take when ordering that she had taped to the counter.  When we deviated from the process, she rolled her eyes at us and tapped on the sheet rather emphatically to get us to give her the information she wanted.  We got ""back on track"" for her, and finished ordering.  Dinner came and it was delicious as usual.

The next time we went in, she took it to a whole new level.  We stepped up to the counter and started to order.  Again we didn't quite stick to the 1, 2, 3s of her strict ordering procedure, so she interrupted us to ask what sides we wanted and tapped on the sheet taped on the counter.  We told her, and continued with our order. Again she interrupted us to say, ""You know we close at 8 o'clock, right?""  

That's when it got really weird.  We began to feel we weren't welcomed there.  It wasn't even 7 o'clock, so we were rather taken back by the fact she was implying we couldn't stay long. She looked at us until we acknowledged what she said. 

Why in the world would she make a point of telling us know that they would be closing more than an hour later?  It's not like we were planning on setting up camp, or lingering over a slow leisurely meal.  It definitely felt like we were not welcomed there for whatever reason.

We finally finished our order, got our food and left... at about 7:10 - nowhere close to their ""closing time.""  And there were others who came in after us, but they weren't told they were closing at 8 o'clock.  

Sadly, her hostility toward us has turned us off of going there anymore.  They have great food (love their BBQ sauce), but I can't tolerate her rudeness any more.  My dollars will be going to the other restaurants in the neighborhood."
1912145,"For starters, we live just a couple blocks away and were thrilled to see this place (and Bad Jimmy's and del Norte) open up... gives us more walkable options for awesome food/drink.  So we finally decided to try Bourbon & Bones at 5:30 on a Friday night when we knew we could probably get in without a crazy wait. 

It was... disappointing based on all the hype we'd heard about it.  Maybe part of it was that we went in with super high expectations so anything less than that felt like a let down.  We ordered the sampler plate, two sides, one beer and one cocktail... and the total with tip was almost 80 bucks (and that was with two happy hour drinks!).  Also, you order your food when you first walk in... and then if you want a drink, you have to get it from the bar separately with a separate bill... ok.  Luckily the place was pretty empty since it was early, so our drinks came super fast and we sat down to wait for our food (FYI, the drinks are served in jars, which is kinda cool).  

So finally the food came and we dug in.  The fried chicken won hands down, followed by hot links, and then the pulled pork... the rest was just eh.  Our sides were the baked beans ($5) and brussel sprouts ($8) - both were good but nothing exceptional - and at a whopping $13 for both, way overpriced in our book.  

I get that this place does everything from scratch and that they've worked to create a hip/alt vibe - but last time I checked, bbq was a way to make cheap cuts of meat tender, juicy, and delicious.  So how the heck do they get so expensive here?!  

Kudos to the staff - they were friendly and engaging - but that's not enough keep us coming back.  

Bottom line: we might order a pound of pulled pork to go but probably won't be back in the restaurant.  When we want our bbg, we'll head over to Ro-Ro in Wallingford - not as cool of a place, but way better value."
794965,"Great burger : tavern with bacon, havarti, onions, and side potato salad...hole in the wall feel...would definitely elite repeat."
579386,"Of all the restaurants that ""looked nice,"" this restaurant lands at the very top of my Area 51 list.  In other words, don't go there.  Overpriced, underwhelming, and a waste of time and money.

I want to start with the quality of the food.  I ordered Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings, which were overwhelmingly sweet with no notes of heat whatsoever.  Then came my main course, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which had the heat overpowered with cream.  Clearly, this was no Jambalaya I would EVER recommend.

What also made my experience worse was the reaction of my server.  When I decided not to order a specialty drink, he raised an eyebrow at me.  Then for the rest of my time in the restaurant, he never stopped to refill my water until after he was ready to hand me my check.  Ultimately, what set me off in anger was that I was charged a mandatory 18% gratuity, a gratuity that he would have NEVER earned given the quality of the service he presented to me tonight.

A word of caution: AVOID this restaurant at all costs.  It looks nice, but will leave you feeling terrible after they're done with you here.  If you decide to come out to the restaurant, don't bother inviting me to come back.  I will refuse no matter what."
1890868,"Beautiful and lively... mediocre food, can't really say it is Mexican, as even the menus is not written 'Spanish gender proper'.  Was there last night , had seafood enchiladas and two (different) margaritas. The food is loaded with cumin and he enchiladas are just a 'tortilla sandwich' filling in the middle, not a proper presentation. 
I gotta say though, FRIENDLY and nice staff, our server in the bar was excellent, she was very fun and not excessively in our face. Salsa is pleasantly chunky but tastes like canned tomato and under-cooked chips to accompany it."
1931528,"Lunchbox Lab is in a cool location in Bellevue, right off the freeway. I was told that the food here is expensive, but I still wasn't ready when I saw their most basic burger was $13, and a milkshake is $6.50!

That being said, the food was pretty good, and VERY messy--be ready to use a lot of napkins and potentially resorting to eating your burger with a knife and fork. I think I would much rather come here for happy hour instead of ordering a burger though. I didn't get a chance to try a shake, but they looked tasty, and can become alcoholic for just $3 more!"
1195245,"Finally, an Indian place that has a decent-priced lunch buffet with items almost never found at other Indian places for lunch. Bone-in goat curry?? Fish curry?? Mango ice cream?? All this for LUNCH?? 

I come here every week during my lunch break and get a massive plate of goat curry. 

Oh, did I mention they serve goat curry and it's delicious?!"
1046308,"Went here for the first time with 2 other friends.  We all ordered burgers and sodas.  I was very satisfied with my Sourdough Burger: it was cooked nicely and had good flavor.  One friend had the mushroom and swiss burger, the other friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  We all enjoyed our meals.
Our server was excellent and made helpful suggestions about the menu.  I will go back again."
512944,"Although the food is good, the Palimino gets super busy very quick and parking can be rather difficult to find if you come passed 7pm (even on a week night). Since the resturante is so busy, its also rather loud."
894413,"I have been going to Beach Cafe for many years. The setting is beautiful with water views from every table. The outdoor seating is always full during the summer days and rightfully so the gentle water breeze with the boats and yachts of every size bobbing at the docks. 

The food continues to be a 5 star cuisine. My favorite is the Teriyaki Chicken Salad, which has been replaced with the Ginger Chicken Salad which is also excellent. If you want a completely decadent dish, do try the Crab Penne N Cheese...just smacking good with every bite. Top it off with one of the best desserts I've ever indulged in, and one certainly does that with the Tres Leches Cake. Unbelievably good!!

Service is consistently wonderful and always with a smile...no matter how busy they are.

I have introduced this restaurant to many of my friends and it has quickly become their favorite place as well."
1968286,I love this place. The Chicken pasty is my absolute favorite! And their Guinness on tap is delicious! One of my favorite pubs to hit when I am in Pikes Place.
1679832,"Darby's was featured on Food Network, so we decided to give it a try.  I don't remember ever having worse service.When I asked for an additional plate, the waiter placed it on top of my water glass. Yes, the table was small, but, that gesture was ridiculous, even by Olympia's standards. Next time, I will make my own onion rings and stay at home."
886292,"Great! Parking is a pain in the ass though.

The food is solid, on par with Shun in my opinion. Will be returning when I'm in down.

Update

Came here on a recent trip to Seattle. Food was nothing like I remembered. What happened to the sushi scene in Seattle...?"
2129091,"I came here the other night with a friend. She got one of the fish tacos, i think the grilled cod one and said it was pretty good.

The service is fast, the salsa bar is nice, and your meal comes with a basket of chips so make sure you get one!

I ordered the friday special: tamales. I've never had them before so I don't have anything to compare them to, but they were quite good. You get 3 fillings to choose from, I chose the pork and chicken. Personally the pork was a lot better so if I ever go back again and get tamales, I am going to get 2 pork ones. The special also came with green rice and pinto beans which were also delicious. I even had left over rice and beans which tasted much better the second day....

Decent mexican joint that's not on the Ave, and if it's a nice day you can sit outside and enjoy the waterfront view :)"
162710,"I had hopes and they were dashed by my trip to TNT today.  

It had the ambiance of something special on 45th St. and was hoping that the food would match, so I suggested to my better side to try it.    We ordered the Al Pastor tortas and the burrito, some chips and guacamole with a couple of beers.   The beer is cold so it was the best part of the meal.   The chips were kind a fatty with no taste and the guacamole was almost the consistency of being blended instead of made fresh using a fork.

As for the burrito it had no particular flavor and was bland and I asked for some hot sauce; but they were out so I used some of those catsup packages hot sauce to give it some flavor.  It didn't help.   The tortas looked better, but was on basically the same thing on a typical hoagie bun.

TNT is a bad execution of a Taco Truck in a store front.  There's not a good selection of home made sauces, ingredients quality can be way better and the only high point is the beer is cold; but didn't come with a lime.  

I'm not planning on going back and will head to the tried and true taco truck's in Burien next time."
2542081,"Got the fried chicken biscuit with an egg on it and gravy. It was so delicious! I was a bit skeptical, living in the south I have known this food all too well. The biscuit was really tasty and well done, not dry and full of flavor. The fried chicken on it was on another level, I would just buy the fried chicken from this place, wow! Service was prompt and friendly and the prices were just right!

The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is I thought the gravy was a little too thick for my taste and lacked a bit of seasoning. I did love that it was pepper gravy and not sausage, only place here that does this I think. Seriously what is up with Seattle and putting bacon/sausage on everything? Even with my critique on the gravy I will definitely be coming back here when my heart can take another hit! :P"
2153550,"Have only been for Happy Hour..but it was great. Had the Steak sliders, Mac n Cheese and Calamari..all of which were excellent and to the quality I would of expected of them. 

Service was prompt.  Why it did not get 5 stars...although service was prompt, the waitress and waiters felt..cold, no personality. I like up beat people not so stiff and formal.  Also, my first 8 oz wine pour was very small compared to the other 2 that I had..I was charged for 3 8 oz wine pours so I think the bartender unintentionally poured small when I was charged for a big and shame on the waitress for not noticing."
1470815,"I dont usually give reviews, this is the first time that I felt I needed to write a review. Got the Groupon for this place and called to try to make a reservation to use it on a weekend. Which is what's stated on the groupon, however I was informed that I can't use it on weekends at all. This is the second time I tried using it. Seems like the owner is putting rules in place making it impossible to use this Groupon.
If I could give 0 stars I would. I should have believed the negative reviews on the restaurant and specifically the owner."
1703846,We thought our dinner was delicious and a great value
2123401,Great decor. Great wine and awesome appetizers (esp the cheese platters) A bit too pricey and really gross entrees....don't go here for dinner. Go for appetizers and wine.
1722237,Blood Mary sliders!
2168562,"I've been there twice, and the pizza was definitely better the first time (sort of cold the second time?), but for West Coast pizza it's definitely top-notch (what can I say? I'm a snobby Italian from NJ when it comes to pizza).   I love the atmosphere here, it's very cute and romantic. Will definitely keep coming back!"
1781815,"East coast style bagels! Yes! I am so glad Einstein Bros Bagels are here.

If you didn't know, Einstein is owned by Boston Market. I wish we had Boston Market here too..."
861780,"Get anything BUT the scallops dinner, IMHO. Still not bad, but way, way worse than everything else, and a bit pricier... quite disappointing. Haven't tried the scallop sandwich yet, but am now skeptical. Everything else here, though, is insanely good - just go, basically, I can't even remember what I like best, but rest assured it's all pretty amazing. Heaven = Paseo grilled onions being hand-fed to me while lying on a hammock."
2668247,"Woah, I'm surprised to see some of the negative reviews!  I absolutely love this place!
As a native Korean, I am quite picky when it comes to Korean food, but this place has never disappointed me.  The food is always fresh and what you get for the money is really a great deal.  My favorite is spicy pork bap -- it comes with spicy pork, rice, fresh salad with really yummy dressing, and two pieces of dumplings -- all for less than $7!  You can't beat that.

I also tried their kimchi fried rice and bibimbap as well. Both were very good.  My husband and I frequent this place whenever we're in the mood for quick Korean food.  The restaurant is also clean and spacious and the food comes out fast. I'm a total fan."
1092881,"Great middle eastern food. good service. kufta kabob , rice - outstanding."
685380,"Came here again and really loved my meal.  Highly recommend the wilted spinach salad and linguini entree. Yummy and good portion size.  Plus I got a hello from the Chef in the Hat himself!  A really charming fella.  Can't wait to see what he's up to next!  Hopefully, more TV shows!"
1679109,Portions are very large!!! Ordered the chicken satay and beef pad Thai. The chicken was slightly undercooked and the beef was rather tough and dry. The noodles were tasty.
526571,"I love living just up the hill from Chinook's. There's always plenty of free parking, plus it's fun to be at Fisherman's Terminal and see the boats out the window. 

The bread is amazing (which is a unique form of torture when you don't currently eat bread). The pan-fried oysters are a gift from God. The alder plank salmon is so good that our server described it as ""the bacon of the sea."" My favorites are the mahi tacos and the chicken cobb salad. Also, if it's peach season, the peach slump is unbelievable."
865554,"Some of their products are now getting expensive.
Now a days, I only go there for thier food."
1290954,"This is by far one of the best places iv been to since I came to this area 2 months ago.
First time trying afghani cuisine and The food was really good. We also met the owner Kabush. He was really nice and will definitely go back there again"
979124,"Having lived in Arizona for quite a while I have developed an affinity for high quality Mexican cuisine.  The first indication of a good Mexican restaurant is the quality of the chips and salsa. According to our waiter, the salsa is made fresh daily by a gal who comes in specifically to whip up a fresh batch. This salsa is about as good as it gets. Hot - but not too hot, and full of rich and complex flavor. The ambiance is both casual and sophisticated.  You could feel just as comfortable in your ""game day"" apparel as you would before/after attending a black tie event.  It's not too dark, nor to bright. The candles in the wall are a nice touch and must take some bit of effort to light every day. It's the nice little touches that make the place feel welcoming and inviting. The staff is always courteous, the prices are reasonable, and the quality of food exceptional. This is one of our favorites. We take all of our out of town guests here and this tends to be one of the more memorable dining experiences."
692241,"A nice energetic little spot within the sprawling hive of energy that is Fremont. Remember when this used to be the mellow, groovy little hippie chick district twenty years ago? No? Impressions of Fremont totally overrun by hordes of eaters and drinkers? Well, that's understandable. Kylie's is in a newer building, and, as of this writing, are still finishing up some remodeling in one of their dining rooms. And they're slammed. If there's food around here, you got a crowd.

They have a pretty short menu, admirably focused. A dozen deep dish pizzas, a dozen thin crust. Pretty much the same pizzas with different crusts. A couple salads, a couple apps. The wings are OK. They bring out pitchers of beer in those big two-pound, thick glass pitchers. Nice. 

The staff is always flitting here and there, very attentive, but very busy. They bring out the pies on plain flat tin sheets with triangular spatulas, none of that silly pedestal business. The crust stays firm and never gets soggy; even the next day at breakfast your slice is still firm and flat, whether deep dish or thin crust. 

The toppings are well integrated and they taste high quality. The Chicago Classic with fennel sausage is pretty amazing. The sausage adds enough flavor complexity just by itself that the rest of the pizza only has to be interesting to make the whole thing dazzle. 

The prices here seem fair, and everything about the experience was pleasant. The pizza could have come out a little hotter, but, overall, there's every reason to come back here."
2151884,"Best Sushi in Snohomish Co.

Beautiful, fresh sushi without the drive into Seattle. My kids love this place for the conveyer belts, but I come for the great selection and reasonable prices. Prices seemed a little higher than Sushi-land in Lynnwood, but I'll easily save that money on gas."
625345,By far the best sushi I have ever had!
856018,"We ordered a dungeness crab cake which the crab cake itself is fantastic, but it came with  a weird combination - sticky rice, sweet peanut sauce and green papaya at the bottom, which taste very strange to me. Price is too expensive $19 for ONE piece of small crab cake.

Fresh donut is pretty good, but you will want to share this with at least 2-3 ppl.

I came with very high expectation since the 4 stars review on Yelp, so was kinda expecting a ""WOW"" from the meal, but it's really just average."
1025511,"Try the Happy Hour!   Yummy treats and drinks upstairs 

Great service and a friendly environment!  My Caesar salad was beautifully presented and the $5 pizza was great!  A must try in Poulsbo."
1890862,"My kid and I were starving one early afternoon and we wandered into this restaurant which was hopping but looked cute. We liked the dÃ©cor: wrought iron ""barbed wire"" screen details, adobe-esque details and bright colored walls (though not glaring). I liked how the hostess took my cell phone number and texted me 10 minutes later to advise that our table was ready. We were seated at a high table for two  but the seats were comfortable, and we really liked how there were hooks under the tables to hang one's purse. Clever!

The server, though busy, was attentive and we were given brunch menus. Great selection of foods and drinks, and reasonably priced! I got a ""salon"" chicken dish (lo-cal), which was really well seasoned, with really good grilled veggies. My kid got a Caesar salad done Mex style, with roasted corn and a zingy dressing. Although she usually eats like a bird, she wolfed the whole salad down. I was amazed; very atypical of her.

This really was a super place and we will definitely be back. My only qualm was with the bathroom which I hoped would have been larger and cleaner, but it was tiny (the stalls barely fit one person. Barely!), and it was dirty, with hand towels strewn on the floor. I think they need someone to tend to the bathrooms more regularly. But other than this downside, the place really was great."
669937,"We went to La Bete during Dine Around Seattle. The food was all beautifully crafted and presented. It is obvious that they put a lot of care into their food. 

I really enjoyed the open kitchen where you could see the chefs at work and also the slab bar was very cool. 

The salads were excellent. I had the Spring salad and my friend had the Winter salad. 

For the entree I ordered the braised rabbit and chanterelle pappardelle. The pasta was tasty and the rabbit tasted fine if a bit bland. The mushrooms were luscious and plentiful in the dish. However, the dish was under seasoned. 

We were never asked how the food was or if we needed anything and there was no salt and pepper on the table. I ate the pasta as is and took the rest home to season it up.  

A trend I don't like at nicer restaurants is assuming the food doesn't need additional seasoning and not putting any salt and pepper on the tables.  This is fine when the food has enough seasoning but this dish did not.

My friend had the Painted Hills beef and was generous enough to share with me. The beef was melt in your mouth delicious. I wish I had ordered the beef instead! 

For dessert I opted for the banana crepe and my partner got the sundae. Again, I think I ordered the wrong thing. I wasn't big on the crepe. The banana wasn't very sweet, just kind of like mushy banana for the filling and one of the two crepes was slightly overdone so it had an almost burned taste. 

The sundae was amazing though. There were crispy pieces of rice sprinkled on the sundae adding texture and and interesting flavor to the dessert.

The decor is intimate and cozy if a little dark and verging on cramped if you're seated at the two tops and need to get out with people at the table next to you. The space also gets very loud. 

I was a bit disappointed as I think 2/3 of the dishes I chose on the Dine Around Menu weren't exciting to me. The salad was great though and the space is cute so I definitely want to return to try more of their offerings."
893087,"You like Beer? You like wood fired pizza?  Then why are you reading this review and not making your way over here? Visiting from Chicago and sampled two flights of their beers and guest beers.  From light to dark, bitter to sweet, they were all great and went very well with my Mt. Shuksen pizza.  Clearly wood fired in hell because the guy who created that sold his soul to the devil."
675095,"Stopped in for the weekend brunch.  The place, for being in a strip mall setting in Lynnwood, is actually quite nice.  The host was very friendly and our service was prompt and polite.  

We had a cup of coffee, average at best, and a fruit plate to start.  

My wife had a generous scramble with avocado and tomato.   It came with a side of potatoes and her choice of bread.  She liked it although could not even come close to finishing it.

The chicken and waffle came highly recommended.  I am a sucker for this dish so I gave it a try.  It as a generous portion of boneless breast and thigh.  The breast was only average.  It was a large cut and the breading was a bit soggy and would slip off the meat.  The thigh was actually good.  It was crispy with the right amount of spice ad seasoning.  The waffle was disappointing.  It was chewy and underdone.  They also pre-syruped the dish.  I prefer to put my syrup on.  I like to control the balance of sweet to the rest of the plate.  This was not a dish I would order again.  

I am looking forward to giving this place another shot.  The prices are right and the menu looks good."
1440123,"Not sure what happened, but at least half the meat pieces in my corned beef hash were either gristle or fat. Have had this dish many times before, but it was completely off last night. Such a pity as I had out of town visitors with me."
2124864,"Just went there for the first time for brunch with my significant other thinking we would have some good food due to the reviews we read in the Seattle magazine, and while the restaurant looked nice, the food was an unmitigated disaster. Two words describe the restaurant: Expensive and bad.

We ordered the potstickers as a starter and when it came to our table, we wondered what it was because it was served to look like two slabs of 8 ounce meat. Really? Pot stickers are not meant to be that large. When it's that large, it's no longer a potsticker but just a pile of pulled pork wrapped in a thin layer of dough. What made matters worse was that it was practically tasteless and had a strong porky odor that did not do it any favors.

Next the Saimin I ordered looked nice, but that's all that was good about it. The soup which is the most important ingredient in a bowl of soup was thick, super salty and tasteless. It didn't even smell good. That too had a strong porky odor. I'm sorry, but I've had noodle soups to die for elsewhere for much less.

My significant other ordered a hash, the portion was tiny to say the least. It came with two huge slices of toasted bread. He remarked that it was mostly tasteless as well and he had to pour the soy drenched chinese hot pepper sauce over his potatoes to make them edible. 

I wasn't too happy with the sauce as it was soaked in soy sauce which made using the hot sauce to make my noodles palatable to me even saltier, so I requested more hot sauce without the soy sauce in it. 

The waitress went back to get some more but she didn't bother to look for the actual sauce, but came back with tabasco and what was left of the chinese hot sauce.

Tabasco with asian noodles? Really???

Suffice to say, we were extremely disappointed and you can be sure that's the last time we will visit this restaurant."
1162997,"This place rocks. I finally went here after wanting to try it since they opened and it was well worth the wait. I had the burger and it tasted homemade and real with delicious yam fries that were crunchy and not greasy at all. My partner had the bangers and mash which I kept stealing from her because they were so good. We split a piece of chocolate cake that was made in house and holy crap, delicious!! I kept dancing in my seat it was so good. This place has a very non-hipster feel, which is appreciated and hard to find in this town sometimes. Two thumbs up, and maybe some toes too."
2163639,"Best vermicelli I've ever had.  Small, but enough room to get the job done.  Friendly staff.  Never had anything here that wasn't great."
827549,"The Delightful Truth about the 909 / 913:

My Burien peeps and I have never been disappointed by this place.  There are 4 distinct reasons to go to the 909 / 913, so I will approach each separately:  

The Coffee: When you walk through the doors, you are greeted by friendly staff at the front counter where they impressively serve Cafe Umbria espresso from real Italian pressure machines by hand pull press.  Beautifully executed and of consistently boisterous, good flavor.  In the case sits a limited selection of pastries, but what is there - is of high quality.  

Brunch or lunch at the counter: You can saddle up to the beautiful granite countertop, or grab a simple table for a bite, and you will be impressed by the delicious egg dishes, -especially the quiche.  Its casual, but nice. Kick back with a paper, magazine, sip the delicious coffee, savor the pastry or brunch items, have a glass of wine, -of which they offer a nice selection.

The Dining Experience: At a certain hour, there is a bit of a shift where you are greeted and seated with cloth napkins. On a nice day, you can choose to be seated in the lovely outdoor patio area that beautifully adjoins the 909 (main restaurant side) to the 913 (bar side).  The owners brilliantly acquired the business next door (formerly a nursery).  The marriage added more dining space, a (much needed) full bar, and the courtyard which perfectly adjoins the two houses. The courtyard is picturesque, appointed with tile, outdoor heaters, fireplace, and a high fence that allows you to dine al fresco without being gawked at by passers by. The food is of generous portion and DELICIOUS. The Chicken and crab crepes are absolutely divine, in a creamy pesto sauce that does not out shine the egg in the crepe.  The chicken romaine salad with lemon and garlic oil and parmesan is a perfect alternate Caesar salad (minus the anchovy and dijon).  The roasted garlic, olive, goat cheese, nuts and arugula with balsamic appetizer plate is absolutely divine. Perfection. The bacon wrapped dates will both wow you and leave you craving more.  The burger is incredible. One of the best around.  8oz of high quality American, ""Kobe"" style beef - with or without caramelized onions -is always juicy, deliciously perfectly cooked and absolutely amazing every time.  The lamb meatballs (may have been a special?) were also incredible.  A flavor explosion.  The steak salad is adequate (not the best).      

The 913 Bar:  It sits as a tiny guest house next to the 909.  It is very small.  I have seen home bars larger.  Space is limited and so is the selection. However, what there is, is mostly top shelf.  You can get an excellent hand crafted cocktail, martini, Manhattan or Scotch.  It has a speakeasy vibe, and acts as the perfect antidote for the somewhat goody two-shoes feel of the rest of the place (dare I say Bellevue/Kirkland?...true Seattleites know what I mean here).  There are two lovely and engaging bartenders. Both a man and a woman, both are late 20's or early 30-somethings.  There is also an older male who is an unlikely bartender.  A large, somewhat motley appearing, kind of awkward,  ""grape ape"" of a guy who is skilled enough, -but out of place like a bull in a china cabinet at this place. They probably would do better without him.  I would also suggest that they extend the bar hours so that you can have a cocktail during lunch hours (this is a mistake).   

The Truth is that we have never had a bad experience at this gorgeous spot that delivers surprisingly detailed, fine food and friendly, attentive service - superior hand crafted cocktails at a fair neighborhood affordable price. It is a gem that I highly recommend."
1864634,"I had the Crispy Tofu Noodles and my husband had the Combo Fried Rice plate. We each enjoyed our meals, but I have to say that the ""spicy hot"" scale is off for them. I said 3 & it seemed like 0. They have real sriracha at the table that you can add. A few spoonfuls made it perfect. 

The Waitress was really nice. They bring water to the table before you order. Being a Southener, my husband asked for sweet tea. She brought out a pot of tea. I have to say it added a funny factor to the night. 

Our children ate off our plates & we also ordered them a spring roll. They enjoyed it. 

We spent about $28 for all of is to eat. Not badly priced for good food. I know I will go back."
1067340,"Awesome!! Tried this place on a whim, excellent! The service was pretty slow, but everyone was very nice and the sushi is worth the wait!"
956510,"I love the atmosphere and the setting of this restaurant. However, I do believe that their menu could use some revamping as well as their service. We ordered oysters on the half shell and they were very very small. The server rectified the situation and all was well, but I felt as if overall the food wasn't worth the value that we paid"
2624385,"Always a wait but always worth it......(they do take reservations so call before, saves a ton of time)

Breakfast is what they do....everything from pancakes and french toast with a toppings bar, to eggs benedict or fruit and yogurt. Something for everyone and every breakfast desire and super delicious. A must for a weekend breakfast with friends or family!"
918632,"This weekend my boy was sick and wanted some chicken pho. He had come here once before and really like it, so I drove over, passing many other pho places on my way. Now, I work right by here and my co-workers were always raving about the sandwiches. 

So, I ordered two large chicken pho, for the boy to have a few meals out of it and ordered a chicken sandwich for myself, minus the mustard and the jalapeÃ±o. 

The boy loved the pho. I LOVED the sandwich. It was huge and only $3.50! I'm so glad I tried it, I'll be going back for sure. 

Very nice employees too!"
694501,"We went here for a birthday celebration that happened to fall on Mother's Day. I called to make reservations for brunch a week in advance and they could only accommodate parties of 2 or less at 9 am (when they opened) or 1 pm. This turned out okay as we were a party of two looking for a roughly 1 pm time, but definitely call early for holiday reservations. 

Unlike some, we were seated as soon as we arrived for our reservation. Now, after tha party of 2 or less talk, she tried to sit us at a 4 person table between the window seats and booths, which was way too close to the people at the booth and at the window, not to mention every waiter or patron who walked by. We were reseated at the two person booth behind us. 

The waitress was nice and friendly, but said ""happy Mother's Day"" 6 times. After asking and verifying that I am in fact not a mom. The benefit to that is they did give me a $15 off our next visit coupon for Mother's Day. Which can be used at the sister restaurants (hello Fondis dinner!). Other than that she was nice and the other waiters bringing our food were polite and friendly. 

Now the food. We ordered the regular eggs benedict and the crab cake benedict. It looked delicious, but it arrived lukewarm at best. Lukewarm crab and spinach aren't great. Cold crab and spinach with flavorless hollandaise sauce really isn't good. The saving grace was the brunch potatoes with rock salt and rosemary. Very tasty! The mimosa was delicious and the blueberry butter that came with the rolls was a nice surprise. 

Bottom line: we may be back for happy hour with the view, but not for a meal. Not worth the price or awkwardly close tables. If it takes an escape plan before you can leave, it's too close."
673463,"Had happy hour here on the patio on a lovely Saturday afternoon with the sun shining. The restaurant very visually pleasing as well so we will probably be back to have dinner sometime.

The cocktails were nice and modern - up to date with what's popular. I had the Sazerac and I think my husband had a Shotgun Wedding? 

The fries were to die for. I liked the dipping sauces.  The olives were amazing little jewels that melt in your mouth. The salads were fabulous, even the simple baby greens salad rocked, there were hidden bits of basil in it. I had sliders that weren't absolutely my favorite but they were still very good. My husband had pulled pork sliders which were very good as well.

All in all the service and food were enough to make me want to go back and take friends with us."
827411,"My heart lives here at  Beloved Mexico. Incredible staff with amazing customer service, and the food is amazing. I always get a veggie burrito with brown rice, and add guacamole, and it is always perfect. We eat here at least twice a month and have never had a bad experience (2 years and counting). I hail from NYC where the taco trucks line Jackson Heights, and Beloved Mexico would give them a run for their money. We love you Beloved Mexico!"
672156,"Great Happy Hour! Which is really the only time I come... Can't beat the prices/portion sizes (crab cakes, sushi rolls, spring rolls, miso soup and rice bowls are what I order). But this place gets jam packed during that time so be aware and ready to wait!"
1831147,"Great happy hour deals. Recommend eating in the Bar. Happy hour special on food and drinks are great. They make drinks right. Keep it up.
Only reason I gave average rating is due to the prices on their menu. I guess you got to pay for the view.
Highly suggest checking out the Bar. If I only rated for the Bar, I would give it 5 stars.
Staff are average but friendly enough. I been to places less pricy and staff were friendlier.

Great view of the Sound. Great place to take a date. Unless your trying to save money."
868866,"Vegetarians and vegans get ready for an absolutely wonderful experience. The bar feels welcoming and warm yet extremely current and trendy looking. Very hard to get that right as most of the time trendy can feel sterile or judgmental. Not here, the decor mixed with the brick wall displays this feeling that it is a warm, clean and ""happening"" kind of place.

I was concerned that sushi may not much of an experience for someone who does not eat animals, as in the past, the best I could get would be miso soup, some sad hard tofu grilled with sauce and a cucumber roll. Just the opposite here! They care and take the time to do it right!

The edamame was fresh, lightly salted and tasty as can be. The beans were still in their shoots, which I favor. Not much needed to be done to ""dress"" up this appetizer because they got it right in the first place: fresh!

We also got a kind of fried egg roll filled with cheese appetizer. For lack of seeing what is was actually called on the menu, it was a kind of current-Japanese twist on the traditional cheese/mozzarella stick. It was complemented with some nicely seasoned spicy fried spaghetti noodles to munch on. Very nice for all those vegans who cheat a little.

We proceeded on to a tofu skin (lightly fried) wrapped around rice type roll. Simple, clean and good. Dip in soy sauce and you are good to go!

Our final dish was a roll, if I remember correctly, had asparagus and some other veggies wrapped in the roll along with small slices of mushroom laying on top of each individual piece. It was out of this world! Melted in my mouth.

The great thing about this place was that nothing was embarrassingly sterile from a vegetarian point of view. They got the little things right like the asparagus not having hard fibers in the roll, or the mushroom not being chewy like fat  on top of the roll. 

Rob, was extremely helpful as well! Not only did he ask if we were specifically vegetarian or vegan, but he asked about other small things like if we were ok with fish oil, gluten free and the like.

GO HERE!!!!"
2133104,"Pure awesomeness. Although I have to admit, I like the chicken better than the beef tacos."
1790136,"Great space to grab a morning coffee and get some work done. I ordered an americano -- excellent espresso! They also have $1 drip coffee refills. My only complaint is that they do not have decaf drip coffee, only decaf espresso."
1040678,"I had a cheese-steak, and food poisoning.  

I had read all your lovely reviews and lived down the street from this place for over five years but had never gone in.  Now I'm sad I did, I've spent the last 12 hours in the bathroom.   My companion had the meatball sub, she said it tasted 'fine'."
1504090,"We were in need of a quick bite before heading off to do our wedding registry -because you certainly can't do that on an empty stomach (p.s it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be). 

There was a bit of a line to order but it went rather quickly while we looked over the menu.  I ended up with the Turkey Cranberry Sandwich, and my Fiance had the Prosciutto Caprese Sandwich.  Food came out quick and was super tasty and prices weren't terrible for the portion size. Sometimes I get the urge to end things with BOOM, like just now."
808524,"In the Bowl is a very unique Thai restaurant located in Capitol Hill. Their menu is entirely vegetarian, and they serve brown rice.

As their title implies, most of their food comes served in bowls of various shapes and sizes, which you will be able to enjoy if you dine in. However due to their popularity and the fact that their dining area is fairly small, it may be best to consider takeout. They have a lot of unique items on their menu, so go prepared to try something new! It is also worth mentioning that food at In the Bowl is a little spicier than other Thai places, so I recommend you order one star below your usual preference. The menu is reasonably priced, but appetizers and side-dishes add up fast, so be careful or your bill might surprise you.

In the Bowl's one of a kind Thai food makes it without question one of the best, and most interesting, Thai restaurants in Seattle. And it is nice not to have to worry about fish sauce sneaking into your favorite curry or noodle dish, as you have to with some of the other Thai places around the city. I love it there, and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a healthful Thai meal.

If you are ordering for the first time you must try the melting culture appetizer (my personal favorite)! I would also suggest the eggplant fried rice with brown rice, and the spicy peanut sauce noodle with fried tofu and udon (buckwheat) noodles."
803847,"The chefs at Endolyne Joe's are magicians: they can make the flavor of really pungent ingredients completely disappear. 

My wife and I visited on a Saturday morning for breakfast. We were quickly seated on the sunny patio, and coffee was poured. I'm a bit of a coffee connoisseur (but I'm not terribly picky) - the coffee here is terrible. It tastes like cardboard. 

I ordered the migas (a Mexican egg scramble) - a plate of a very unappetizing orangey-brown colored food. With cotija cheese, chorizo and green onions, I expected lots of savory/salty flavor. It had none. It was just a mess of dull, overcooked salty eggs. Very disappointing. 

My wife had the hash, which she thoroughly enjoyed, but I didn't care for, either. It was also dull in flavor, for my tastes. Though I will say: they cooked the two poached eggs (that topped her hash) perfectly. 

I'd (very hesitantly) give Endolyne Joe's another shot, as many people do enjoy the food, but after my first visit, I wouldn't recommend it to friends."
875101,"A very delicious place to get lunch in downtown Seattle. The food here is amazing and the prices are very cheap. It really doesn't get much better than this for Thai food in Seattle. Please note that this is a very ""hole-in-the-wall"" type of place and probably would not be suitable for a first/second/third date unless you know your date enjoys places like this. In summer it can get pretty hot and stuffy but the food is well worth it."
2158791,"Communal wood tables, ambient lighting, the smell of wood-fired pizza pie, and excited customers awaiting their very own Serious Pie. Be prepared to wait for a table, this location attracts quite the crowd. Bring someone who loves unique flavor combinations here, their taste buds will thank you."
841170,"I was really excited to try this spot. The reviews made this place sound awesome. We went to the pizzeria so we could see the daily specials. We ordered the large pizza with half of it having sausage and mushrooms and the other half with clams and garlic. Good lord the pizza the huge. We got back to our place and started chowing down. I think it's because of the size but I didn't think it was all that great. There wasn't a good balance between the cheese, sauce and crust. I could tell the toppings were very fresh and of top quality. Next time, I'll order the small for myself and have to rate that one. The large was just too big."
1116869,"This is a good place to have a good time and eat the biggest, best pizza of your life!"
1784457,"I ordered the Pad See Ew and to go...so maybe it's different when you sit down in the restaurant, but it was pretty terrible. There was about a 1/4 inch of oil in the bottom of the to go box. It was pretty flavorless and just EXTREMELY oily! Too bad...it is really close to my work but I will not be going back especially for a $12 lunch special."
870378,"Fresh seafood, lively atmosphere, and great service. Sat in the back 'patio', quite cute. Had a reservation around 9:45 and the place was hopping!"
777828,"W&C is conundrum.  It is basically an oyster bar that has some really really good dishes supporting.  Oysters are not really Lisa and my thing but the accompanying dishes were a revelation.  If you're a foodie you know about W&C, as it is on most best of lists and it easily worth searching out and putting your name on the list.  If you're not a foodie read the reviews to get a sense if you are up to experience.

Here's our story, we were directed by the bartender at Elliot's.  Showed up on a crappy, cold, rainy day and was told our wait would be an hour plus.  Looked at the menu and decided it was not worth the wait.  

A couple from NYC saw us leaving and walked a long block in the crappy cold weather to educate us that this is one of the top 10 restaurants in the US rated by everybody, who is anybody as a favorite.  They had flown to Seattle just to eat at the W&C and were not disappointed.

We since met others from Seattle, who thought W&C was easily the most overrated dining experience in Seattle if not the US.  

After dining here, I can see both points.  I found the attention to detail and the combination of flavors a delight. But I can also see if the small menu doesn't suit, the clattering of the crowd can get on your nerves and the intrude on your calm to the point that you begin to wonder if the world has gone crazy."
1905737,"Think clean comfortable upscale sports bar...fabulous food, incredible flavored lemonades (I'm a non-drinker).  Has become a favored neighborhood haunt. Do not leave without trying the BBQ chicken quesadillas!  Good handicap access."
777337,"Ordered the Oysters.  

VERY SMALL, the size of DIMES.  No one should ever serve oysters that small when Ivars is down the street.  $16

Ordered the Goat Cheese Fondue.  VERY SMALL.  Less than half a cup of cheese for two people???  Are you kidding me?   Why are the portions so small here? $9

Ordered the Cod.  I have cooked better myself.  Why do people rate this place so high.  I will not be coming back.  Better places on Cap Hill and Bainbridge.  $20?"
981025,The best !  So good.
1504085,"We made a reservation and were seated promptly.  To start we ordered red pepper and feta dip which came with pita wedges- it was pretty good just wished there was more for the price.

I ordered the Spring Lamb and my partner ordered the Yiouvetsi.  The couple next to us arrived about 10 minutes after we were seated and their food came out before ours.  I had a feeling that when they received their food that it was actually our dishes because they looked a little confused at first and then dug in.  I then watched the chef pointing at our table and talking to the waitress about how those were in fact our dishes and they went to the wrong table, but too late as they already started eating.  

They never formally told our table that our dishes went elsewhere, but did tell the table next to ours that they had received the wrong dishes.  My partner and I had just spent nearly 2 months in Greece this past summer and were really looking forward to some great Greek food again and it was just okay- maybe an off night.  Maybe our dishes had been rushed to make up for the mistake-not sure.  We decided to end the meal with Baklava which was absolutely delicious!

Our server was great, and the service was friendly-we did receive an apology for the wait which was appreciated.  I may be willing to give it another go some other time, but I'm not sure that I can justify the price for the quality."
895141,"I didn't know that disappointment was a kind of sushi roll.
My girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner while on the hill last night and I've got to say that it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while.

After being seated it took our server five minutes to bring us menus. 
Another five minutes for two glasses of water. 
It then took her a full 20 minutes to come take our order. I ordered the chicken karaage, my girlfriend ordered some a la carte sushi and a California roll off the list they give you. 

This is where everything really went south.

15-20 minutes later my chicken karaage comes out. It took them another 25 minutes to bring my girlfriend's sushi! By the time her sushi came, my dish was almost cold. It's pretty much restaurant serving 101 that you never deliver one person's dish that far in advance of another's. This is completely unacceptable. You leave me with the choice of chowing down in front of someone with nothing to eat, or letting it sit there and get cold while we both wait. Not once were we informed of any delay in her food coming out. in fact, our waitress never checked back with us once.

Now, I'm not a cheap person, and I don't mind spending money on quality, but when I spend $13.95 on one dish, it should at least come with some steamed rice. What I got was 6-7 pieces of fatty, dark-meat chicken on a plate. I understand that kaarage means deep fried, but the amount of oil retained in the chicken was unprecedented. I've eaten the same dish at half a dozen other japanese restaurants and never taken a bite and had fryer oil come out of it. To make matters worse, you could taste that they hadn't changed their fryer oil in a while. I couldn't even finish it because I could feel my stomach begin to swirl. 

My girlfriend's sushi was another disappointment. Not only did they miss two pieces she had clearly marked on the order sheet, when we informed our waitress she told my girlfriend that she hadn't marked it! The waitress brought back the order sheet, ostensibly to prove her point, and we both pointed out that both missing pieces were clearly marked. I understand that everyone makes mistakes, but it's poor service to set out to prove your customer wrong, especially if you're the one that's wrong. To top it all off, when our waitress went back to get the missing sushi, she only brought back one of the pieces! We just gave up at that point. The overall quality of the sushi was good, but I think my girlfriend was so disheartened by the whole experience that she couldn't even enjoy it.

This experience was a perfect example of how to do customer service wrong. Had the quality of the food been top-notch I would not be complaining as much. However, when you couple mediocre food, with abysmal customer service, you get a one-star yelp review. Needless to say neither of us will ever be returning and we will warn all of our friends to stay away."
1675167,My girlfriend and I went to check our their happy hour since we've heard good things for the most part about this place on the corner. We were a little hungry but mostly thirsty for some of their good beer. We ordered the nachos and a pound of wings since the appetizers were half off. Sounded like a good deal but the nachos were 5.50 with the discount and that was with no add-ons and they were mediocre at best. The wings were pretty basic with no real kick to them. Next time I'm hungry I might try the Ynot next door but the beer here was good and at 3.50 a pint I really couldn't complain. Next time I'll skip the food and just drink the beer. I'll probably be back sometime in the near future.
1283532,"I'm kind of annoyed with this place right now. 

I've been going here for a while now as well as the West Seattle location. The almond crossaint is my favorite but lately....it's really lacking In flavor, it used to have a distinct almond flavor like Marzipan but now it doesn't taste like almonds at all, don't know if their being cheap or what and not putting any almond flavor at all. I do have to say the spinach and cheese crossaint is really good though. Dessert wise I haven't had any that has really wowed me, it's good but nothing spectacular. I stick to the crossaints here. 

And the other day I went in and got overcharged for a pastry, called and talked to the manager and she was rude and said I was wrong and that it was because I got the ""seasonal"" tart, that's funny cause I was taking pictures of the pretty pastry, looked through the pics on my phone and the one I got was not seasonal. I'm pretty sure she just said that so I'd leave her alone."
1784759,"In a city with so many great restaurants, don't waste your time with Terra Plata.  We had dinner on a weeknight and the service was terrible, the food was disappointing and the bill was about triple what the experience was worth.  To add insult to injury they lost my friend's credit card at the end of the meal, couldn't find it, and didn't offer to reduce the price of his meal to make up for the inconvenience.  Just a terrible establishment all around."
1337822,"Cute and quaint tea shop with a wide selection.  The guy at the register was helpful and informative in making my selection.  I was feeling indecisive about what I wanted and he asked what kind of flavors I like.  I mentioned that my favorite tea was licorice and he said he could do a straight licorice tea or had some blends available.  Showed (ie. via smell) me some options with licorice and found a blend I was excited about that also had ginger and lemongrass.  Woo.  Sold.  

I liked the teapots the teas come in...on top of a container that has a tea light (how fitting) in it to keep your tea nice and warm for as long as you need.  

My only issue was that I came in with a gift card that didn't seem to register.  Yes, it might be an OLD gift card, maybe 2 years old, but I feel like gift cards shouldn't expire for at least 5 years.  Not a big deal, card wasn't worth much anyway.  But did enjoy the atmosphere and feel of the place."
1028244,Food was okay...I had the clam linguine. There was rap music that we could hear coming from the back kitchen which wasn't too pleasant when you are suppose to be enjoying a nice Italian dinner.
156844,"Delicious vegan fare. Charming bistro - seats 25 tops. Super cute bar (seats 4) - drinks are worth ordering. Service was pleasant.

The breaded portobello steak is fantastic - hearty, flavorful and well-made. The portobello is evenly breaded and dressed with a grape caper sauce, paired with purple potatoes. Menu is varied and unique - look forward to returning to try the spicy cajun mac & yease and HH (M-F 3-6p, Sun 4-10p)"
2130124,"The restaurant started in an apartment complex to feed the Thai Airways staff!  

We tried our usual for lunch - Phad Thai Chicken, Red Curry Chicken, Jasmine Tea.  The total came to around $34 (about $8 more than your average Thai restaurant).

Rice really needs to come with appropriate dishes, or be more reasonable - $3 for a bowl of rice seems a bit excessive.

The flavors were good and fresh.  The costumes are a hoot - but we weren't sure why we were paying more for our simple lunch.

We'll continue to go to our other local favorite - Royal Orchid"
1135315,We recently moved to Pioneer Square and their new shop in that neighborhood is 1/2 block away.  The Pioneer Square shop serves sandwiches that are amazing.  The selection in the meat case is great. Definitely will be a regular here.
1313292,"I guess it must depend on the day &/or time of day but, despite all of the negative reviews about poor service & delays, the service that I got on a Sat morning was just fine.  

I got there when they opened at 10 & had my choice of tables.  I ordered coffee and the chicken & waffle.  The coffee was served immediately and the waffle & chicken was served in just a few minutes.

As described (in the singular), there was only one waffle & it was large but was not crisp as I prefer my waffles. The very dark brown color of the fried chicken also suggested that it was over cooked, wc it was; not extremely so but enough to render parts of the wings a bit dry. So, the dish could have been improved by cooking the waffle a bit longer & the chicken a bit less.

On the other hand, the coffee was free flowing; I got refills promptly w/o delay.
So, I'd say that if you're in the mood for southern cooking, the Kingfish is worth a try.  Just don't expect perfection & you'll do fine."
691471,"I like to think of myself as more of a burger connoisseur, not a chubby girl. I love burgers. I don't discriminate. I am an equal opportunity burger eater. I will try every burger at least once. And when it comes to Fatburger, I will try them over and over. The portions are ridiculously large. Juicy and flavorful, get it topped with anything from plain cheese to jalapenos, mushrooms to bacon. Add a side of fries and thick shake and your meal will be well worth the money."
1168198,"I've given this place so many tries, because I believe that it should be good. I mean, conscientious meat...fancy buns...awesome toppings. What could possibly go wrong?

Maybe it's just my personal taste, especially when I pay over $10 for a meal. I think that gourmet hamburgers are generally a tasteless waste, and this has place has definitely reinforced that idea for me. There are a lot better options for that amount of money in the surrounding area. I definitely wouldn't say their burgers are bad, but they're not particularly good either. You won't remember what it tasted like the next day. 

On the up side, though, they do have some amazing ""curry"" mayonnaise which makes an awesome fry sauce. Maybe that's what has really brought me back here more times than I'd like to admit."
1897295,"I'm torn.. here's why:

Ramen- gross... no effort whatsoever!  Please spare yourself from any ramens here.. no flavor and  a bit on the oily side.

Curry: Tasty!  Japanese style curry done right, with the options to even pick your spice level! I had the croquette curry and it was super tasty!  The croquettes had just the right about of crisp, even sitting on a bed of curry!  The portions were so large, that the plate defeated me and I had to give up mid way through.

I hope this place sticks around, since there isn't a big Japanese curry selection on the eastside!"
754818,"I just can't even with Roxy's. Every time I come here is better than the last.

First of all, they have whitefish salad. NO ONE HAS WHITEFISH SALAD. If they also had chopped liver (which I'm sure they don't have only because I'm the only person in the world who still eats it), I would just die and go to heaven.

I brought my very fussy New Yorker parents here for brunch and my dad practically peed himself over the fact that they had salt bagels. He ended up ordering the lox scramble, which he informed the waiter was ""second only to [his mom's]."" I'm not sure if the waiter understood what a HUGE compliment that was. (For the record, my grandma could cook the shit out of a lox scramble, you guys.)

I later came with my WASPy husband and in-laws, and they were all satisfied with the variety of decidedly non-Jewish food (aka. they serve bacon and tater tots here). I also opted for an alcoholic beverage on that morning (I'm sure you can guess why), and found it to be just as amazing as the rest of the food.

If I lived any closer, I'd probably be at this place every weekend. If you're not already a regular, make yourself one IMMEDIATELY."
1311301,"Such a Greenwood gem. I wish it was more popular, I feel like people think it' off the beaten brewery path (read: not in Georgetown/Ballard). The place has killer beer selection, delish food, and a chill friendly atmosphere. You can check out what beers they're pouring before you go! Brilliant. 

Let's go back to ""delish food."" Sometimes breweries and bars can get away with fried greasy fare because drunk people will eat almost anything (I've served it and seen it). So places that emphasize beer think it's perfectly acceptable to put melted Velveeta on store-bought chips and call them nachos, defrost a Sysco pretzel or slap together microwaved sandwiches in the back. Managers know people aren't going to call it dinner, or fill up beer space in their bellies with with food, so why try? This is not the case here at Naked City. 

My chicken salad I had here deserves it's own paragraph in this review. It was that good. That fresh, that juicy, that flavorful. This is at a brewery, folks. Take note. Other times I've enjoyed their sweet potato fries, their pretzels with stone ground mustard, and their well-crafted sandwiches. All top notch and delicious. Think of this place as a solid restaurant with a wonderful beer selection, rather than just a brewery!"
2136265,"Must try if you are a Taiwanese food fan in Seattle. IT's just like Taipei's deli and the price is reasonable. 

Try the shave ice."
1293029,"Loved it.  I had lunch here during SRW and had marinated eggplant, brown rice bowl with tofu and sesame balls.  My co-worker had chicken wings, caramelized coconut beef, and something else (i can't remember but it was good).  Great service, awesome ambiance, good food.  I especially liked the eggplant and my co-worker loved chicken wings.  All their sauces and condiments are made inhouse and were great.  Not sure why some reviewers said they're not unique.  I am definitely going to frequent Tanaka San.  Another exciting restaurant by Tom Douglas!"
866218,"The deluxe burger is not bad, but nothing special at all. It fills a niche in cap hill--really fast and cheap food. There's always at least a few  people in line, even in the wee hours. It's convenient and really cheap, but not as good as In n' Out. The shakes are nice, pretty much what you expect. Can't complain because they're so cheap and open really late."
1829787,"I stopped by for a late lunch recently and was very disappointed.  I think the other low reviews for Longhorn are hitting the mark.  In short, the food just wasn't very good.  Barbecue usually follows one of two schools of thought.  Season the meat with dry rubs and smoke or flavor the meat after cooking with incredible sauces at the table.  The Longhorn apparently does neither.  The meat was cooked perfectly but it lacked flavor of any type.  The BBQ sauce on the table was slightly better than catsup.  This might be good for people who suffer from hypersensitive taste bud syndrome but not me.  I like full flavor BBQ that makes you roll your eyes (and sometimes your toes) when you eat it.  In addition, the lighting was very poor.  To the point that it was difficult to read the menu or inspect your food when it came to the table.                
  
On the good side they have a nice bar area with a good selection of adult beverages and several beers on tap.  They also have a nice stage in the bar area for live music.  The staff was also very friendly and attentive.  

The owners could easily raise this establishment by a star by simply going to Costco and buying a few cases of Cattleman's or Bull's-eye BBQ sauce.  They might get a two star improvement by putting a BBQ sauce trio on the table of Hickory, Spicy and mustard sauce."
322581,Not a bad place to visit. Good menus and great drinks. Can't say it is off the hook good but definitely worth it.
1299132,Average food at best. We went on a Thursday night and the music was insanely loud. Don't come here if you want to hold a conversation with your significant other or friends. I thought the food was overrated and the prices are unjustifiable.
669722,"It's funny how you forgot that you reviewed a place before and then laugh at what you wrote because of how extreme the experience was... and how it must've escaped from my memory altogether. (see previous review back in '09)

Anyway, I definitely had a better experience this time around when I came here for a work lunch yesterday in one of their private dining rooms. We had a set menu and a few of the entrees were family style which was awesome! There was so much food leftover and a lot of good variety of their menu that we tasted.

The food that stood out to me were the chicken and beef satays and the seven flavor beef. Yummy! I especially liked that the beef was topped on a bed of bean sprouts - my favorite! The vegetarian spring rolls were actually quite tasty as well, but not as firm as other spring rolls that I've had.

In general, the service was great even though there were only two guys serving about 20 of us on that long table. They were good about refilling our waters and iced teas too. 

I really love the layout of the restaurant and the ambiance. It feels modern but still keeps the Asian-esque atmosphere too."
243345,"I'll probably be yet another person to misuse the word ironic but HERE GOES:

I used to go to Seattle Deli all the time but moved to the Saigon Deli because I thought the sandwiches were a little bit better.  I had certain pangs of remorse because I believed that the Seattle Deli was a little cleaner.

Then last week my wife got food poisoning from the Saigon Deli and I heard that the Seattle Deli made a list of 10 dirtiest restaurants in Seattle.

Ironic, isn't it? NOTE: May not be ironic, I'M NOT AN ENGLISH MAJOR DON'T JUDGE ME.

Their sandwiches are good though.  Maybe the rat poop is laced with MSG? NOTE: this is JUST CONJECTURE I DON'T KNOW IF THE RAT POOP IS REALLY GETTING ON THE SANDWICHES."
2144238,"Very non-descript building.  In fact, not even a sign on the outside that I could see that said Paseo.  I just followed the line down the sidewalk.  Awesome inside, once you get there.  Walls and ceiling are painted pink and green.  Since I do not eat what this place is famous for, I opted for a fish sandwich, which I thought was very good.  The others in my party ordered a pork sandwich, a chicken sandwich and a ham and cheese.  First, the pork.  My wife was very adamant that this is not even close to the best Cuban sandwhich she has eaten.  Come to Burbank, we'll show you a Cuban sandwich. She said it wasn't bad, but not all that.  I guess she should have tried the BBQ pulled pork, which we heard was killer. Must be, as I could see people sitting outside the restaurant everywhere chowing down on them. Next, the chicken. Not bad, very tasty and flavorful.  And finally, the ham and cheese.  Out of the four of us, this was said to be the best sandwich. The negative is that, with the prices, none of the sandwiches come with any kind of side, not even chips.  I did order some black beans, but they were just okay.  Nothing to write home about.  
It took us about 30 minutes from order to delivery.  Was it worth the drive and the wait?  Sure, because I had never been here before.  Fremont is a nice area.  But this is not worth going out of the way for.  Oh, BTW, the gentleman working the register was awesome, kudos to him for being polite and patient."
953387,"I am absolutely not impressed.  My husband and I have made it a tradition to do ""Wally's"" at least once a year for their  Halibut and chips.  I have always looked forward to their fresh halibut but I was absolutely floored when we went there tonight and I was served ""FROZEN"" Halibut.  I am from the Northwest and I KNOW MY HALIBUT.  They said it was fresh.  NOT.  We will not be back. TOO BAD.  We really liked it in the past but I can spend my money elsewhere."
812769,"Good food, great coffee.  If they just brightened the place up with new flooring and tables ( it looks very grungy inside-definitely not anything like ""sunlight""), and made sure the service was always attentive, they'd be perfect."
854577,"Had the Lola breakfast and I was really impressed with that. The smashed potatoes and sausage were really great. I also got the donuts per the suggestions on yelp and I'd say they are really good but, $8 for six donut holes is just a little absurd. 

Service was great overall. I would go back again."
547546,"Stumbled across this unexpected gem during lunch on a Friday after shopping for  books.  Truth be told, I was aiming to get Thai food but the hostess there took a little too long, so I left and wandered down a few doors and found Miyabi.  I hadn't even noticed there was a Japanese restaurant in the little strip mall area.

Small intimate restaurant.  Service was extremely attentive and friendly, despite being so busy.  I sat at the sushi bar, ordered a simple sushi combo. All the fish (salmon, yellow tail, shrimp) was fresh, delicate and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  And some of the best California rolls I've ever had. Haven't had sushi this fresh and authentic since leaving the east coast where we were spoiled by my Japanese in-laws, who were particular about their sushi consumption.  Lunch came with a miso soup and a light salad.  Price as expected for the quality of the food.

Really looking forward to coming back!  Absolutely recommend Miyabi!"
1899813,"We almost always enjoy great food, great service, and great atmosphere at the Bellevue Red Robins.  Last year, we went to the Bellevue/Redmond/Overlake Red Robin for the first time.  Our waitress and the manager were both fantastic.  This past weekend, we enjoyed the usual great food, great service, and great atmosphere, but with ONE exception:  My wife bit into a MOLDY French fry.  We brought it to the attention of our waiter.  He was sincerely apologetic and brought us a new batch of French fries.  Of course with two orders of burgers, we had bottomless French fries anyway.  Our knock is that the Factoria Red Robin management apparently isn't concerned enough to personally contact its patrons at the restaurant about moldy food."
2130571,"I'm writing this review from memory.  I was in Seattle back in Feb/March 2013 but I distinctly remeber this place.  Why? We ate here twice.  Although it calls itself a diner, it's more like a bar.  On our first visit on late Sunday afternoon, the joint was packed.  Always a good sign.  Luckily, my friend and I were seated in short order.  Timing is everything.  The ambiance, the food and the service was spectacular.  The food, though, was as good as it gets in the comfort food category.  And, my bloddy mary drink was one of the best bloody marys I ever had.   If you are native to Seattle and havent visitied this establishment, you are missing the basics of living.  If you are in town visiting, make a point to drop in for eats."
785055,"I have read a few reviews of this place and would agree with the slow service comments.
My husband and I arrived to Seattle and needed food before we passed out!  Not that I wish to rush my food or anything, but we were pretty much the only ones in there and we waited a fair while until we were served.
We both had a sandwich and I indulged with some tater tots, which were delicious!!! 

The decor is something else entirely, wonderful to sit and stare at.  There is also a Juke Box that is free so you can choose what you want to listen to.

This place is quirky and I would recommend it, but not if yo're in a hurry."
863895,"We stopped by here for Brunch  and  my husband, who isn't a fan of breakfast foods, loved this place, as did I. And the atmosphere alone was awesome.  The waiters/bartenders all were very colorful, in a good way.  Loved to look at their tattoos. And just the building in general had so much to look at.  But the food, was amazing.  I got one of their versions of the Eggs benedict, it had a little kick to it that made it good and still familiar. My husband got the charizo hash brown dish they had.  He loved the Charizo and ate all of his food. The portion size was a little much for me, but perfect for my husband.  And the prices were just right.  I highly recommend this place, even if it were just to stop in and look around with a cold brew in hand."
803523,"Absolutely AMAZING!  How this restaurant doesn't have a 5 star average review is baffling. 

Our party of four all did the chef's tasting menu and named our own price of $40 per person. I would highly recommend doing the tasting menu, the attention to detail was unparalleled. Each course was delicious and creative. We were treated to oysters on the half shell, potato leek soup, mussels, clams, light salad, squid, pork belly, halibut, and amazing cheeses. Exceptionally local and perfectly prepared. 

We walked on the ferry from Seattle, quick and easy trip - well worth the effort. Great spot to celebrate a special occasion or just a nice dinner out."
1141085,Great dinning experience from the server Robin to the fantastic halibut
2138004,"The Happy Hour is good and they have good drinks in the menu and the bartenders make them good! But if you ask for a customized drink which is not in the menu (like a RITZ or a Appletini), they mess up your drink!
The Happy Hour has good prices and good menu items. Its kind of pricey for regular dinners but it has a good atmosphere."
1725734,"Please note, I give stars on a curve.  The Majestic doesn't try to be a Michelin Star ultra fine dining restaurant.  It is a classic American Cafe.  In that regard I give it Five Stars.

My wife and I were seated in the bar by choice.  We like being by windows.  Andrew was our server, and he did and EXCELLENT job.  Always prompt and conversational.  Knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and ready to give good recommendations.  I had the strip steak.  It was possibly the best steak I have had in Washington.  I grew up in the Midwest and am generally unimpressed by the offerings out here.  While the meat lacked flavor it was perfectly trimmed and cooked.  A good value at $20.  I like a dry wine, but my wife likes something a little sweeter.  Andrew recommended a nice blend that just hit the spot between our preferences.

When asked to suggest something interesting on the salad front, Andrew recommended a very nice spinach salad with raisins, hazelnuts, croutons, mushrooms (which he thankfully left off at my request), and a raspberry vinaigrette.  It was delightful.  The broccolini was fresh and nicely prepared.  The potatoes au gratin were nicely prepared and presented, but I prefer a sharper cheese combo than the one used.

I should also note that they have a very banquet room in the basement.  I officiated a wedding there that evening and was impressed with the decor and the service."
815940,"I'm giving them three stars because it's a nice place to hang out, I liked the coffee and the staff are friendly and hard-working. As a cafe, I have no problem with this place. Unfortunately, they're trying to sell themselves as a bakery and the food is terrible. The breakfast sandwich I had here contained bacon which was all floppy, undercooked fat, on bread that wasn't fresh or toasted, and the zucchini bread I had was definitely stale."
1346225,"Believe the hype!  Manuel and his brother really know the meaning of authentic Mexican food and great service.  Everything we ate was outstanding and fresh.  The location is a bit off the beaten path, but it's 100% worth seeking out.  Can't wait to go back and have another marinated beef stuffed chili rellano!"
803900,"Its been 3 1/2 months now, and I'm still waiting for my gift card that my wife and I were promised. We had asked for take out on one of our orders, and once we had arrived at home, we found that we were missing some of our food. So, we called the manger to address the issue and the manager had promised to send us a gift card for the inconvenience. We called about the gift card after about 3 weeks and the staff had no idea what we were talking about. Very disappointed, its almost as if we were lied to."
1042061,"For the depth and range of talent showcased at Tula's I am happy to pay a cover charge, even if sitting through only one set.  But $15 for a watery well Manhattan served (sloshed) by a dour-faced waiter who rolled his eyes when I returned the menu and said, ""drinks only""?
     My usual watering holes charge me $8-$12 for a Makers Manhattan served with a smile.  $15? Seriously?"
166556,"24 hour/Late Night Service

Nestled between the Seattle Times and Amazon buildings, this spot has breakfast, lunch and dinner as well. However, I keep coming here after hours. The lounge/bar is open late so you can order snacks, drinks, or just dessert.  They also have a TV so you can catch the latest scores or news blurbs."
2130085,"When we first arrived, the line was insane.  What time did I have to get there to get a seat?  My wife and I went there at 4:30pm and the line was already down the hallway.  People were still rolling in after us.  When the doors opened, lucky for us we got the last two seats at the bar.  Everything looked so fresh and exciting, we couldn't wait to order.  Started off with some bread and butter, it was oh so good.  Next was the watermelon panzanella and two dozen oysters.  After that we ordered the speck with jersey ricotta, preserved pumpkin, and balsamic.  This dish was truly my favorite, a must have!  Finished the journey with some clams and grilled sardines.  For dessert we ordered the caramelized figs.  My wife loved this dish way too much, we wanted to order another.  Service was a 10 and the food was even better, a must eat regardless if there was a line."
1663534,"This place was good for my first time in. 

I ordered the Pad Thai, since it was my first time eating here. Before I went I did check out the yelp reviews like always before trying a new place. The pad Thai was kind of dry but still good. Called in a to go order it was done super quick for the lunch hour but the place wasn't real busy though... I would have given 4 stars but the lady wouldn't honor the 10% check in discount saying it was expired... than why is it still on the yelp page????  I will probably go back sometime soon and order something different."
1071818,"I visit here quite often, they have many nice menu selections and the staff is very friendly.

There's not much to make it stand out, but thats not really the point of a family pancake house, its just good food at a reasonable price... i wish they were open 24 hours because its better than Denny's and Bremerton needs more places to eat after hours! 

Try their buffalo chicken salad, it's legit."
806179,"My sister and I ate here and we both go out often.  The place is cramped, the food only average and the prices are high.  We will not go back

Furthermore,  I have spent several months in Buenos Aires and this is no comparison to the fine quality meat available in Argentina"
1897124,"Great service, amazing sandwich.

Yes, they are smaller than normal, but honestly, I feel like most sandwiches are way too large anyway. To me, the value is in the fresh ingredients, on their unique sandwiches. I highly recommend trying the Turkey + Wasabi Coleslaw. It will blow your mind. 

I would love to see hot sandwiches one day, but that certainly wont' deter me from going back in the mean-time. Great job, guys!"
1320489,"Kylie's was participating in BattleDish this past weekend. After seeing it was on the menu, it was on of my top picks and I was pretty excited.

The three of us sit down at a (dirty) table, which was cleaned as soon as the waitress came over to take our order. I asked her what meat was in the sausage and she said she didn't know, ""it's fennel sausage"". Yes, I get that, but fennel isn't a meat! Ok let's try this again, ""Is it pork or beef?"" She responds with "" All I know is that we get it from a package, smoosh it ourselves and put it on the pizza"". Hmm, I see, that sounds super appetizing. Seeing my apprehension, ""Ohh, I THINK it's beef."" She kept repeating it over and over as if she was trying to convince herself it was beef. Meh, didn't want to eat pork on ""accident"" so I opted for the California cheese. I put in 2 tickets (which was equivalent to $10 dollars for two slices of pizza) which was collected in exchange for my order. 

Anyways, pizza was served cold. I don't like cold pizza unless it's leftovers from the day before and I choose to eat it that way. When you receive pizza, it should be so hot you burn the roof of your mouth and have to nurse it for a week after.

Halfway through the meal she comes back and asks us how everything is. At this very moment in time I was putting chili sprinkles over both slices of pizza. I tell her all our pizza's came out cold and she offers to reheat my second slice in the microwave. Mmmm ok, let's give it a shot. (Who serves microwaved pizza btw?!)

She comes back a few minutes later with my pizza slice (with dried tomato finger smear stains on it the plate. Dirty plate that wasn't mine? Check) and gives me my pizza back...cold. It also wasn't my original slice of pizza because there were no chili flakes on it!! Hopefully some poor old lady didn't burn her mouth off with how much spice I put on the first piece. Who knows who ate it?!

I'm pretty skeptical. The crust was decent, but didn't have enough crunch to it. If you're going to give me a cornmeal crust, there better be texture, please! I enjoyed how saucy it was (I usually order any pizza with extra sauce) but I wasn't a huge fan, flavor-wise. It wasn't robust, didn't have depth of flavor, nor did it taste original. The cheese was fresh. 

I get they were busy for BattleDish, but it's not hard to serve hot food, and know your menu.

I don't care this wasn't ""authentic"" would rather it taste better than it looked. Kylie's is like an unpolished diamond...there's potentially potential."
2779400,"While waiting for the waiter to take our order I observed a female busser clear the table across from us. She poured the remains of a glass of water that was drank from, used, and left behind on the table by the previous guest. The female busser used the dirty water to wash the table with a cloth that appeared soiled. Immediately following, a new party of guests were seated at the table without being properly sanitized. After finishing our meal, we received our check and were given hard candy with our bill. We did not take the candy. We left it behind on our dirty table. When we left I was able to stand back and watch our table be bussed by the same female. She again poured the remaining water from one of our dirty glasses that we had drunk from onto the table and washed the table with the water from our dirty glasses. She then took the hard candy that we left behind on the dirty table and placed it back into the candy bowl at the bussing station. I spoke with the hostesses on the way out about what I had witnessed and received no response. Food - really - not worth your time and money!!"
815972,"Not too expensive, clean, VERY good service, tasty food, options for those with dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, etc,).  Enjoy."
1106767,"I only eat here late night when i'm extremely hungry, desperate, and too lazy to cook. The happy hour is decent priced...but it's all fried food. This place oozes as an attraction to obese Americans by making their fried foods so cheap. I ordered a wedge salad with dressing and other accoutrements on the side to hopefully get something lighter and fresher. The dressing was literally poured all over the salad, and the wedge of lettuce looked very wilted. Gross. I dont know how that was acceptable to serve to a paying customer. I told the waitress about the mistake with my salad, and I was not offered a replacement or apology...the snotty waitress just stated that she didn't hear my preferences. 

Not only is this place full of weird customers late at night, but when I last went there the police were called. Some belligerently drunk man was accosting all women at the bar. It took the staff 20 minutes to decide that this wasn't appropriate after the man had interrupted the dinner of the couple next to us, and made a commotion. He was escorted out by some large line cook, but the damage had been done. Then the police came and questioned everyone and it turned into quite the show. All in all, I think there should have been an apology for the lack of responsibility the restaurant manager had that night by allowing a man to accost customers. I do not intend to come back here. 

I highly recommend this place if you feel like eating fried food, letting the grease seep into your GI tract, and gaining some extra weight from calories that aren't even worth it."
902527,"Really good Saigon seafood feast! I would say it was better than what I've gotten from the Crab Pot. It was very flavorful, very fresh and the portion was decent amount for two people. Very surprise because I was hesitating to try a seafood meal at a Vietnamese place but I'm very glad to I gave it a chance."
1205402,Family pizzeria.  Just ok at best.  Sauce is more like rich pasta sauce and crust is chewy.  Great location. Mediocre pizza
1639430,"Just moved to Bainbridge from Atlanta...have tried nearly all the ""on island"" eating places but thought I'd start with Hitchcock, as it is the most like the places we tended to eat in Midtown Atlanta.

We have been there 4-5 times...both for the ""regular"" menu and for the Monday night Bruciato pizza pop-up.

Each time we have had great service, extremely tasty and refined cocktails, and outstanding food.  Not much on the menu for my vegetarian fiancÃ©' but everything else just pops and shines. Hitchcock is our go to place for our Seattle and beyond visitors.

We just came back from another Monday pizza night...decided to splurge and have the margherita and puttanesca pizzas (yes, there were just 2 of us and we felt a bit gluttonous but they are on the small and thin side so we justified it) along with 2 manhattans for me and a glass of italian wine for fiancÃ©' and an aracini starter.

This won't mean much to most of you, but the pizza is as good as any we have tasted, including Antico and Ammazza in Atlanta (look them up) so we will try to be Monday night regulars schedules permitting.  Our server (Katrina) was great as usual and remembered us.  The only glitch in the evening was my ""scolding"" the owner/chef for his child jumping up and down in a booth as it was disturbing the couple in the booth behind him....felt kind of bad but he was gracious and I was kind of low key about it so hopefully I didn't offend him.

This is a restaurant that could thrive in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, and Seattle....it is hip, fresh, and quite honestly spectacular.  HIghly recommend it."
2425675,"I've been here two times and both experiences were good. Their tofu is cooked well and the noodles were tasty. The drinks are a little on the sweet side for my taste. 
The decor and atmosphere is beautiful."
817714,"It is great that you have a wide selection, and they have a gluten free menu as well. The sushi is great, and again, the selection and constantly evolving menu makes coming there always exciting, but you can still reach for your favorites if you want. It makes for a great place to run in for an afternoon snack if you are shopping at Bellevue Square, or dinner with a family. 

While prices have continued to rise since they first opened, in the past year they have risen dramatically. With every previous price increase a couple cheap items have stayed behind, like cucumber rolls or avocado rolls. Simple, but allowed people to mix the fancier and the more filling. Now, they have raised prices across the board and it is no longer easy to go in without feeling you are paying more than it's worth. 

The food is still enjoyable, I and I've enjoyed the changes they've been making to the menu, but the price point is getting a little too high for me to justify."
799674,"I had a chef's sampler of nigiri - all which were yummy. The one with shrimp on top was finely prepared- interestingly a slight gooey texture that was oddly pleasant. Also tried fried shrimp head, which tasted like those shrimp crackers you can get at the asian mart. 

The staff attended to our party of 12 pretty well.

Tip: They offer a free dessert to the birthday person.

Three stars because it was good but not zOMG amazing that I want to go here again and again."
1895105,"Picked because of yelp ratings.  Above average.  Fried olives were great! Pizza was nice and charred on the bottom.  Try the deserts, we ordered three and they were not your normal items... Nice dinner"
674298,"we had the nutella ice cream, i wouldn't say it taste exactly like nutella, but it had a hint of it and it was good. the ice cream was nice and creamy and i can't wait to come back to try some other flavors. the deli itself was pretty spendy but i mean .. to be expected since almost everything is from the european countries."
690800,"Waited and waited and waited; (45 minutes in) then my name was called, but it was a mistake?! Unbelievable. More waiting (55-60 minutes in) and finally my name is called again. We're seated in some kind of dingy mid-floor area. We see carts above and we see carts bellow. We call and motion to carts, but to no avail. Occasionally we're thrown a freaking bone and a dish or two are brought to us. I start to take a closer look around and notice we're next to cleaning products and a large supply of roach motels. Also, I notice that huge garbage cans are being moved about transferring both clean and dirty dishes to and from stations. This place, aside from horrible service, is a health risk disaster. Despite pleasurable past experiences, I will no longer dine at Jade Garden and I highly suggest others avoid this deplorable establishment."
2756439,"Enjoyed a great evening with my wife enjoying happy hour. Crab cakes were excellent, the trio of potatoes were enjoyable with curried ketchup, wala wala onion dip or several others. Our highlight however were the $3 oysters - we enjoyed several dozen. Finished the evening with a New York cheese cake. No disappointments for the evening. Keg wine was also a nice surprise"
836565,"First off, let me say they I've been to John's several times, and that should say plenty of what I already think of this place. The food is excellent, ambiance/family feel is great, and I've brought and recommended several friends to this restaurant in the past. My rating stands at 5 stars for these reasons, but last night I need to speak about. They were busy, packed actually, so I understand why what happened, happened....BUT, that said, let me recount the evening. My partner and I, along with our friends, had made reservations, but got hungry and  had called to ask if we could come early and Ally (?) said sure, no problem. We arrived, were sat, by Ally, and she told us the specials and took our drink orders. John's wife (I can never remember her name) was our waitress. We ordered our meals, I asked if I could change my starch choice to the pasta and she said that'd be ok. It started getting busier, and the whole vibe got ""brusque"" shall we say. Dinner arrived and the starch order got turned around, giving my partner the pasta, bringing that to her attention apparently wasn't a good idea because the response was ""I can take it back to the kitchen and re-plate it"", which of course was silly, we could manage that in our own. Dinner was as always, exceptional, but the service still was hurried and frantic, and quite frankly perplexing, because the small dining room was adequately staffed, I could be petty here and mention the bread and ice tea, but I won't. The actual problem was this....when it came time to pay the bill, my partner pulls out the Yelp coupon ($30 off for $20), and yes he should've brought that to her attention at the start of the meal but didn't, but even so, the ""experience"" deteriorated quickly. She said that the coupon wasn't good for the whole table because we had separate checks, which we already understood.....that's why we had separate checks....duh! So when she presents the bill, the gobbly-gook that we looked at was confusing to say the least, and upon asking for an explanation, was given a rather terse response that her husband set up the computer system and that she didn't couldn't tell us why the check didn't make any sense with the coupon discount. The check had 3 different discounts that no matter how you looked at it seemed that we either received only $20 off or possibly $40 off, but no where on the check did it say $30 off. So ok, whatever, pay the bill, tip the waitress 20% on the pre-discount amount and leave, say goodnight and thank you, get into the car and start to question again the check and did we get the deal we were supposed to. So I went back in for a clearer explanation and you would've thought I slapped the Pope....""I don't understand it either"", ""it's my husband who sat up the computer system"", ""I'll go get him and have HIM explain it to you""! During this whole rant I'm telling her to not bother her busy husband, but no, she couldn't explain it, nor could her son (the waiter) so her husband MUST come forth. So, here he comes, rushed, perturbed that he was pulled off the line for this customer who had ""requested"", dare I say, an explanation, an accounting, if you will, of this check. I didn't ask him to come out, I told her not to bring him out, but nonetheless, there he was, giving me this even more confusing breakdown of how the tax is calculated on the discounted amount and therefore that's why it's printed like it is because it's not his problem to pay the tax and yada yada, all the while I know he's thinking he needs to flip the filet for table 3. 
Now, i hate to say this, I've been in the restaurant business all my life, well over 40 yrs, so I DO understand when you're really busy what a pain in the ass it is to explain to someone something that is perfectly clear to you, but apparently they can't comprehend the most basic things in life. Look, coupons are a necessary evil in today's marketplace, unfortunately, but if you're going to offer them, and therefore honor them, then the very least you can do is to present a check that clearly states $30 off, so I don't have to feel like an idiot trying to figure it out or to dare ask for a ""simple"" explanation. 
All that said, I'll still keep going back, I'll still recommend the place, because it deserves it, I'm just saying everything could've been handled alot better."
1952845,Great lunch menu deals and fairly fresh fish quality. Try chirashi bowl.
804318,I moved from Fremont to the ID.  This is my new Paseo.  Get the lunch special with the Bbq Pork & ask for mustard.  Heaven.
946322,fabulous
963093,"This is my favorite lounge of ALL TIME. I love it here. I'm a regular. The only time I come is Happy Hour (4pm-7pm), or Wednesday because it's Ladies Night and all drinks are half off. Any other time and you're looking to spend $15/drink. 

The waitresses wear very sexy work uniforms that consist of a corset and some black pants. Most of them are very kind and chatty. A few of them are bitchy and catty. (Maybe it's because I'm a girl?)

I love their food. I recommend the Beef Tenderloin, Margherita Pizza, Shrimp & Crab Dip, and Spinach & Artichoke Dip. As for drinks, they are ALL sooo good you nearly can't go wrong. But the best drink is the Pink Passion. Runners up include: Strawberry Bliss, Cosmo, and the Pomegranate. 

The band can be hit and miss. I've seen it be good on two occasions and terrible on one occasion. I usually like the DJ, but the last time I was there and I made a request he didn't play it. He sticks mostly to the Top 40 radio hits. 

I can't give much input besides Wednesdays and Happy Hour. For all I know the weekends are awful? But it's a very upscale trendy place with a predominately middle aged crowd. Good times and beautiful people! I love the drinks and the food!

See ya next Wednesday ;-)"
1636547,"Tip - don't come here with 5 or more people.  Apparently the place is so small, there are only 2 tables that will seat 5 people (assuming all the other 2 people tables aren't already used up).  

We had made reservations for 8pm on a Friday night for 5 people.  When we got there, the guy said it would take 5 minutes or so for the people to finish up.  15 minutes later, we still weren't seated.  The waiter then split us up into 2 groups (2 sat at bar, 3 sat at table next to it), which made for 0 conversation between the 2 groups.  I then just asked the table behind us if we could switch [because their table could seat 5], and they generously said yes.  I wish the waiter had had the balls to do that instead of the customers.  

Service was a little slow; one person's food came out almost at the end of dinner.  The food was okay; nothing to write home about.  Maybe if I had come with 4 people, I would have given 4 stars instead."
881934,"The house margarita is good, well balanced and potent!

First time I've ever had mole and I'm not a fan. The carne asada tacos were fantastic though."
1770772,Pretty good selection of beer and I enjoyed the live music even though they sang off key. Just an all around good vibe about this place.
1339979,"This family owned gem serves fantastic food!  the service can be frustratingly slow but the food is all well worth the wait and tease!  The wait staff seems to be fairly amateur but in the most adorable sense.  

eggplant moussaka is very flavorful and the best eggplant dish i've had in seattle!
pides - really good crust 
chicken meatballs were oversalted"
2121223,"My son and I went to Skillet for breakfast/lunch. I had the  Fried Chicken Sammy with a balsamic dressed salad, which was far more delicious than my homemade balsamic version, or any version for that matter. I ordered a bloody marry, since the addition of bacon jam grabbed me with intrigue. Much to my disappointment, the overall flavor demanded a side of cold prawns for dipping. The cocktail sauce flavor was unmistakable, for me, and I just couldn't drink it. My son agreed on the unique taste, but downed it despite his disdain for cocktail sauce... Should I be concerned? Or just add vodka to my next batch of sauce? He ordered Mike's Scramble, which he enjoyed and a ginger beer that I took a sip of... I wish I'd ordered that! It was super tasty! I'll definitely go back... I just won't order a bloody marry again."
2130812,"I love the 5-P....seriously. Been open since 1929, has good food, good drinks, good people, good jukebox, good views....good gawd, what more do you people want? Go there anytime (open 24/7) and get a good meal at a good price, listen to some tunes and just enjoy. If you are uptight...relax or go somewhere else. Best and biggest chicken fried steak in Seattle. Period."
703962,"The two times I have been in the service is slooooow. The second time was ridiculous.Other customers where seated after us and out the door before we got our order. The staff acknowledge that they were slow and gave a discount on the bill, but I had to wait 20 additional minutes... no joke... for the bill. It's tough when you have three kids to feed and it takes 45 minutes before you get your food. But, they are quick to fill beer and bar drinks."
678030,"fun HH and such a beautiful locale on a seattle summer(y) day! friendly and attentive staff, yummy drinks and good food. i don't eat seafood, and even i had some great options to choose from."
1017750,"This place is amazing. I feel like I just stepped into a magical fairyland of delights. Incredible food, cute little place, a little tricky to find but now I will always remember it. They even have coconut milk mochas. Come here for breakfast, they also have vegan options!"
2123951,"It's an experience!  The service staff is 5+ starts hands down!  If you are looking for a 10-15 dollars meal, this is not the place.  But if you are celebrating anniversary or any special event in your life, this should be on top of your list to dine in."
1502125,"Tasty brunch, I had the rainy day hash ($10) and we shared the St. Germaine carafe for $12 on a Saturday late-morning. This is a very popular place, many families were noticeable here. We got seated in the bar quickly, but our server was a little slow. I'd love to try them again for brunch, but maybe go earlier to get faster service? The hash tasted great though, and the bar seemed to have a great selection of alcoholic breakfast drinks and beers. Many options on the menu. The vibe in this place is nice, and I enjoyed the bar area. The bathroom is up a couple flights of stairs, but that didn't really bother me. All in all, an enjoyable brunch that I'd like to do again."
975437,"A HAIKU REVIEW!

A fine pizza joint
Toss back a beer, a pie, too
Then toss back some Tums"
1944583,Scallop chowder is the best. Red chowder was good too.
1686268,I agree with a previous reviewer that the steak is a little blah. It really needs some seasoning. The Osso Bucco was absolutely delicious though. It literally fell off the bone. My husband had the spicy prawn meal and raved about it.
1638935,"the calamari was some of the best I have every had, the sushi rolls were also pretty good and no complaints about the service."
1284343,"Came here for date night and then went to a movie across the street.

Great service and nice atmosphere (small fireplace outside and a large one inside).

The goat cheese appetizer was delicious! Fish was cooked perfect, and the crab cakes...wonderful!!!! The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars was it was a little pricey.

But we will defiantly go back on a special occasion"
988868,"decided to try this place after a heavy night of drinking.  The interior has a nice layout and has a good vibe.  They had about 1/2 the tables occupied and the people all seemed fairly happy.  My gf decided to try a chicken burger and I went with the sliders.  Both dishes were delicious, however given the time it took to make them, they had better been perfect.  From everyone I've spoken to, apparently their food prep time needs some BIG improvements.  The food itself was very delicious and I was so very happy that the slider meat patties weren't cooked to death.  Overall, we'll go back and give it another try, but if the service is as slow as it was the first time, I'll complain to the manager and we won't be back."
159067,"We went back tonight and it was equally as amazing as last time!  This evening we ate in the bar instead of the restaurant for a cheaper night out.  I had the bbq shrimp again cause they were so good last time, and the filet mignon appetizer.  It was unbelievably amazing.

My husband had the burger and it looked fantastic as well.  The fries it came with were steak fries - generally I prefer skinny fries, but the steak fries were tasty too!"
268452,"doughnuts are THE best, but also love the Lola breakfast....think i get that 90% of the time! the smashed potatoes are very YUM! my sisters had the lamb kabobs and loved them as well."
855298,"I am hopelessly in love with Mario, his SS El Camino, and his, a pizza pie!!!

Thanks to a special person of mine, I have found NY pizza bliss...they even do it better than NY herself!!!

I have had Mario's too many times to count and at all times of the day...the pizza is always good (better when you get a whole one) and it heats back up so well at home (in the oven).  I don't even know how these guys do it.  It's like pizza magic. Everything is always good...except the salad, that's gross.

Even better, they have zero problem making a pie with half white and half red sauce!!!  Mario's staff's' willingness to accommodate has saved many fights over red or white sauce.  :)

If I had to complain, I would say it gets a bit confusing sometimes.  When you're at the booth and feel like a 2nd or 3rd slice of pie, I am unsure if I'm supposed to go to the ovens or try and flag down the bartender (who is always swamped).  I've done both and they both seemed to have worked.  I'm sure one way is not preferred, but who knows.

I'm a sensible guy, and I'm sure most of you out there are too.  I know you all can appreciate a joint that serves top notch, NY style pizza and a couple of beers for under $10 out the door...

Do you, your mate, and your wallet a favor...go get some Big Mario's a Pizza!!!"
947117,"Delicious, quick service & cheap!  The only potential downside is the ambiance -- pretty rundown and divey but still a great place for Pho!"
840243,"First, the food here is very good, affordable and the portions are just right, The Kielbasa is very good, probably the best I had in many years. We (four of us shared our orders) also had the Bruno's Schnitzel, Cabbage roll and Potato Pancakes (Latkes) which were all very good as well.

The staff was wonderful, friendly and accommodating ... with that said however, the service here is slow. We were seated after a five minute wait, but then waited almost 15 minutes before our orders for our drinks and food was taken. The food was delivered within ten minutes, but then we had to wait about 10 minutes after we completed our meals for the bill. Overall, we were there for almost a hour and a half. I will admit though, they did get pretty busy after we were seated.

There is a good selection of German and ""the former eastern European block"" beers as well as a small selection of domestic beer and wine. I had the half liter of Warsteiner Premium Dunkel, a hard to find Dark Lager Beer and it was as good as I remember when I was in Germany.

During my visit, the noise level was very loud, there were two birthday parties going on, and both were playing a drinking game of sorts."
1304422,"Interesting concept and the food was ok.  My husband was not a fan, but we may give it a try again in the future."
1446337,"We came to O'Asian Kitchen to meet my nephew and his family for lunch.  My niece-in-law is from Taiwan, so I definitely trust her choice for Chinese dim sum.  

The food was great!  Of course, we let NIL, Jeng Yun, order...she comes here all the time and speaks the language.  When the slightly pushy servers (this IS dim sum) come around with their trays of goodies, it is hard to say no, but we let NIL do all that.

The free parking (in the building underground parking) is a huge bonus.  Seattle parking is expensive and often hard to come by.  I guess it helps them get business, but it made us very happy.

We had a large party (8) and were accommodated easily and with no hassle.  Highly recommend."
2777855,"A fun addition to the Eastside dining scene. I do really like the dumplings, but my favorite thing is the Mango Boba Smoothie. The green tea one is great too. 

I am knocking off a star because they often run out of some of the popular flavors of dumplings (like all 3 times I was there) and it was early - like not even 7pm."
813938,"Over the last few years I have aquired a bit of a taste for good southern cuisine, so I was thrilled when I found Marcela's!  Went there twice for lunch last week and so far my experiences were excellent.  The first day I got a Crawfish Sausage Po'Boy and the next day I went back and got the Fried Catfish Po'Boy with a side of friend mud bugs (crawfish) and all of it was primo!!  With some restaurants that serve catfish, you just never know how good or bad it will be, but here it was fresh and flaky!  Oh and of course they are Saints fan friendly! (I love both the Hawks and Saints for the record!)  I can't wait to keep going back to explore the rest of their menu!!"
790785,"My favorite Thai Food in all of Seattle.  Great food, a quick and friendly staff..what is not to love?"
2767793,"The Good:
-------------------
Prices: Dirt cheap, half price on Sundays.
Food: Fanfreakingtastic, outweighs all negatives in the end.
Children: Not even allowed in.
Bathroom: Clean, amusingly resembles an elevator.
Groups: Fine; just order all of the appetizers & let everyone get a few bites of each.

The bad:
--------------
Noise pollution: Through the roof, hope you like techno-jazz.
Space: Cramped, 50% bar.
Drinks: Doesn't serve coffee or iced tea.
Appetizer portions: Minuscule.
Deserts: Only 1 option.

Recommendations:
------------------------------
*Cannelloni: People able to tolerate spicy food claim this has a flavor beyond ""pain.""
*Bacon wrapped prawns: Salty, but taste far better than you'd think.
*Sea bass, comes with some really tasty side dish of hominy & spinach in a tomato-infused sauce that tastes somewhat like minestrone.
*Pheasant: Seriously, how many places even serve this?
*Gnocchi in truffle sauce:  So good you'll order 3 plates & lick the plate clean. Comes with a slice of actual black truffle; crunchy with a nutty flavor. I'd love to get my hands on that sauce recipe."
2735304,"I love used to love this place but lately it has been lacking, still ok for a decent meal especially for the area."
1898172,"Drove by this place awhile back and decided to try the place out this weekend.... Glad we did!

Got the mushroom+arugula+egg pizza and was in love with how flavorful it was. The crust was crispy and not burnt like some other places. Only thing I wish that was slightly different for the pizza was if the egg was running and not cooked through but it was still tasty. 

Will definitely return to try out their other selections!"
1701351,"Pleasantly surprised by the inside since the outside is kind of scary especially at night. Be careful to make sure you lock your car doors they have a sign when you enter so not sure if theft from cars has been a problem.  
Inside greeted friendly, nice inviting dÃ©cor. 
Good size dinner menu. the appetizer sample was good and had a few favorites. Got the panang and massamun curry both really good. But the panang you couldn't get no stars which made it hard to share with daughter. you have the option of white or brown rice. Really good brown rice. 
I would come back but wouldn't go out of my way."
808462,Good sushi. The chefs where legit. Wait staff made me feel like I was at an Applebee's.
712534,"Fun spot for tapas and a drink - upgraded to great spot when you have a private room and some time to chill. They keep it a bit dark in here for my taste, I'm always pulling candles over to the menu or stumbling around bags and chairs on the way to the bathroom. Perhaps this is a personal problem, but I wish they'd kick a little more candle power into the room.

The tapas are mighty tasty, creative veggies, flatbreads, and tiny forkables. I'll put it in my face if they put it in front of me! The drinks are a bit of a downer if you're looking for draughts and they didn't have my favorite gin, though they provide a nice selection of wine. 

Definitely get a gaggle together and reserve a block of tables or a room, it's always been a way better experience when we can carve out a space and a server. And go for the bacon wrapped scallops. Bacon - wrapped - scallops!"
1685346,"So...writing this review isn't exactly a task I want to do. I've been to El Chupacabra several times before, and I had always felt that the service was mediocre/ the food was brilliant. Their food is AMAZING. 

HOWEVER. Yesterday was my birthday, and because of my love for this joint's delicious Mexican food, I decided Chupa was where I wanted to have dinner. Big mistake. I've never really had BLATANTLY BAD SERVICE from their staff before. Our waitress, ***Christina L*** completely embarrassed and underperformed for this bar. 
*1st: Her attitude of self-righteousness with a mixture of subtle condescending way of communicating with us was ridiculous. Talking to her made me feel disrespected. 
*2nd: Christina didn't use a notepad to write down our 5+ people orders. We all thought, shouldn't you be writing some of this down?? You could sense something was going to be wrong. It's like she wasn't even listening. 
*3rd: I specifically ordered, ""The Basic"" burrito with chicken verde, wet, large. She responded with a small burrito, wrapped in foil (absolutely nothing like what I ordered). I politely told her something like, ""Excuse me, this isn't what I ordered."" I repeated the order back to her. HER RESPONSE..some snapping, bitchy, ""Well YOU have to order it wet."" My entire table couldn't believe she was being serious. Haha..like are you for real? Did you really just take it there? 
So she snatched the wrong dish off the table, and brought back the same burrito, except a small size. At this point. I didn't want to make a scene. So I told everyone in my party to remain calm, eat, and vacate.
*4th: Although we were a party of just 5 people...*CHRISTINA L* DECIDED TO PUT ADDED GRATUITY ON A $50. You know how disrespectful this is? :( 
Damn Chupa. Just damn."
882885,YUM.  Absolutely everything here is delicious and the atmosphere is fun and romantic!
1217299,"New Owners; Not the Same. 

After many years of being a family favorite, some new owners brought changes this week that aren't for the better:
- can't order at the counter anymore; attempt to make it a sit-down restaurant not only kills the vibe but fails when servers are slow
- friendly staff replaced by people who spent more time making excuses than making things right (we miss Maria!)
- baby back ribs were a little drier with much more sauce
- sides were half the size as before
- wine glasses were smaller
- they were running out if everything from brisket to wet wipes. 
Only positive? Kids said Mac & Cheese was better. 

We might give them another chance after they've had more time to get going. But for now, we're sad to see Rainin' Ribs change."
230325,"I don't have anything new to add, other than the staff flow has figured it out and are on completely on the ball,  and I keep finding myself coming here (a lot) and am always happy - so time to up the star!"
1288716,"Fantastic food prepared with the freshest ingredients that are sourced locally and regionally. Respectable wine list. Even the house wine was above average. Very nice and attentive staff. The manager read my note about a birthday surprise when I made reservations online: she came out with a little chocolate treat and lit candle after we finished our meal. Awesome! Thank you!

Alder Wood Bistro is a small and cozy restaurant so go really early or make reservations.

We enjoyed our first visit and will be back when we're in Sequim again. :)"
172593,"I love this place.

I came here for lunch with my boyfriend.

We had their rootbeer, burger and a sour cream and onion pretzel. 

The burger was delicious and juicy. You have to eat it fast though because the bread gets soggy fast. I meat was very tasty. I will definitely order this again. 

The pretzel was also delicious! I was expecting it to be sprinkled with some sort of sour cream and onion seasoning but you actually get a dip. This was MUCH better than what I expected. I loved it and can't wait to try other flavors.

I want to try this place for dinner and drinks with friends and maybe play a game of shuffleboard. 

I'm a big clean freak and this place was great. Its hard to find a nice high ceiling, clean, well ventilated place in Capitol Hill so it was a nice change of scenery."
819318,"My wife and I ate here for the 1st time last week Saturday nite.  We had # 31 & # 32 on the menu.  Food was different and very interesting.  We liked it plus we found friends of ours in there eating too. Price is inexpensive, lots of menu items to choose from.  I would like to try more items on here too.  We will be coming back.  Service is poor but friendly."
811774,"This place is great...if you can catch them when they happen to be open. We checked their website, drove over all the way from Redmond (with out of town family, just to share Bratz with them) only to find a hand-scribbled sign saying they were going to open at noon that day. Well, it was already 12:15 and we waited for another 10 minutes with not a glimpse of life. 

If these guys ever get serious about running this restaurant, it can be stellar for cheap, quality German food. I really hope they do!"
167858,"here or le pichet are my go to's for french cuisine.  the foods are relatively the same and everything is so affordable it really can't get much better than this.  i do like cafe presse a little better just bc it's bigger. all the bartenders and wait staff are super cool and are more than happy to help with any questions or suggestions.

i love coming here on the weekends for a glass of wine or champagne, pomme frites and their divine foie."
2121475,"I like this place.  Kinda trendy, hipster-ish.  It's easy to see what they are going for.  I had the deconstructed corned beef hash and eggs, which was an interesting take on the dish.  Very well seasoned and cooked and everything tasted very fresh.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast and of corned beef hash, but only when it's homemade.  Apparently, I missed out on not trying the bacon jam, as it is very popular.  Next time I'm in, I guess.  As I recall, the coffee was very good, too, which is always important."
1099831,"Service: Extremely poor for 2PM on a Saturday

Food: I got the Original Chile Rellenos and they were disappointing. The batter was super soggy, making them unappealing. I did not finish them. 

Drinks: I got the Acapulco Margarita, which was tasty and not overpriced. 

The interior and ambiance of the place is great. I think I will end up giving this place another shot, but not anytime in the near future."
1933165,"Love Tablas, have eaten here at least 20 times..always consistent flavors, great service, and now they have added menu items for lunch...flat bread pizza is a must for me..."
804190,Wonderful! Food is great. Atmosphere is relaxing neighborhood-y.  The staff are super.  The cookies are to die for - and breakfast?? YUM. YUM!
2148647,"Good selections, very tasty, a bit pricey though.  I would eat here again."
257214,"Service was kinda how do I say this?......crappy?

If you've ever been to Cactus Club in B.C., its teh same idea....dumb hot girls, zero mentality and the food is NOT all that for the price.

Save yourself the time, money and hassle and go somewhere else."
338516,"Great food, tons of options, fast service, and what a fun concept for a restaurant! There is now a spacious deck where you can sit out and eat. We will definitely be going back soon!!"
174810,"I love Sushi, but this isn't one of my favorite spots. 

I went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night with a groupon we had purchased a while back. Service was a little slow, but only one guy seemed to working. 

The food was okay, came out a little slow & was cold by the time it got to us. Ordered ribs, salmon teriyaki and a couple of rolls. What was really upsetting was that at the end of the night, the server told me I couldn't use my groupon because some of the things we ordered was off of the happy hour menu. I said I'd gladly pay for those items separately and use the groupon for the nonhappy hour priced dishes, but apparently he couldn't do that? 

Every place I've gone to has been able to accommodate that request, so I was a little annoyed. Instead, he changed all the happy hour priced items to full price, which almost doubled the bill. 

Yeah, not likely to come back here. Groupons were made to get good deals and hopefully find good places. Not in this case."
1889278,"I stopped in to Rainy Day's Caffe with my daughters today (they are 10 and 8) for milkshakes. We had some time to kill before picking up their older sister and I thought it would be cool to check out a local place. 

I don't think I will be back. The girls behind the counter were more interested in flirting with the guys in seating area than actually being attentive and taking our order. It was so loud between the music, the machines, and the girls yelling over all of the noise to the guys in the lobby that I couldn't even hear my daughter. 

My girls liked their milkshakes, and the coffee was average, but next time, we'll head to the Starbucks where the focus is on the customer and not your date for the football game."
2130707,"Well, freakin' yum. This place gets points just for the bizarre juxtaposition of (a clean, respectable) dive bar/awesome breakfast joint.  First of all, have to mention our server - positively adorable AND great at her job.  Had a veggie skillet (potatoes and all the usual veggies, with eggs) and toast. Wish I could remember what the cuzfriend had, but I know she loved hers, too.  

Go here for very good breakfast (everything in that skillet was cooked just right), served fast and dirt cheap.  

Helpful hint:  Better if you can sit outside (it was chilly the morning we were there), since the place is uber dark to start the day with."
1176385,"Foods great.   Everyone was great but the bartender was in slow motion. I've seen paint dry faster! No pep in her step!  For crying out loud at least tell me ""hi, I'll be right with you"". Nope.  No bueno. Teach some people skills to your bartender.."
2161648,Avoid the dungeness crab roll sandwich because the texture and flavor are sub-par and it isn't cheap.  Stick with chowder only.  The New England chowder in a bread bowl was awesome!
1765101,"Two words: CALL AHEAD. Oh, and two more: CASH ONLY. Since this place is frequented by so many, save yourself the time and call ahead with your order...I have never had to wait because of it!  Yeah, the B&I is sketch, and I miss Ivan, but I will keep going back and maybe even buy a blinged out cover for my phone if it means I can still patron the Tea House.  Of course I always order the garlic chicken--sooo good! Just realize they are sauce-less (garlic-infused I am guessing in an over-night marinade or something), so grab some siracha or sauce of choice to dunk them in if you want.  I have never had a bad plate of food from here...and most recently I also ordered the pork fried rice.  The best part about it was that is was legit BBQ pork...not the bright red stuff most places use...which holds a special place in my heart...but I'll take fresh BBQ pork over that any day.  It is probably better that they don't have a menu to go, or I would be calling in an order weekly. Great food for the price!"
948420,"Of the two or three times I have been here, it is just okay.  I got the rockfish sandwich on special, and it was actually quite nice, but the (presumably temporary summer) service was a little underwhelming.  There are nice people there, and regulars seem to be the ones that go... and I have only been for lunch, not dinner or drinking.

Anyway, not so crazy about it.  I prefer Doc's, but it won't hurt to stop in."
2634806,I love everything about Ixtapa in Lake Stevens. The staff is great my family has been going there for years. The chips and salsa are always fresh and the food is always amazing. I highly recommend this place to everyone
931793,"This place is amazing.  Their homemade bread is thick cut and the perfect texture.  The sandwiches are mostly the traditional fare but prepared perfectly.  The decor is a little campy but it seems to work for them.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We were there at an off time so it was not crowded but based on other reviews it have a long wait.  

We had the BLT on marble rye and the chicken salad on jalapeno bread.  The BLT was the better of the two.  Slightly warm with crispy but not burnt bacon.  The chicken salad was good.  It did not have too much mayonnaise which is always my fear when ordering it at a restaurant.  The jalapeno bread added a slight spiciness without overpowering it.  Their cookie was disappointing so I would recommend just sticking to the sandwiches."
1856205,"After having found our favorite breakfast haunt in a state of disrepair, we set out to find another amazing place for our repast. I'm so glad we did! The atmosphere is fantastic, and the coffee is delicious. Between the four dishes my family and I shared, it would be impossible to name a champion. The French toast, italian omelette, croque madame, and corned beef were to die for. Do yourself a favor and have a side of sausage patties, because it will transport you to a land of magic and dreams. It's a little off the beaten path, but well worth it!"
805304,"It pains me to write this review. I love Nook, I really do...I have literally planned my weekend around going to Nook on several occasions. So why the 3-star review? It's because of the awful changes they've made in the last few months.

In the past, I've never had a problem with waiting in line for Nook's biscuits. They're entirely worth it, and I get that the wait is just part of the experience of getting food at a small, popular breakfast joint. That said, the hour-long wait I experienced a few weeks ago was ridiculous and mostly avoidable. They were operating on a ridiculously inefficient system, and the barista seems to be the cause of it. I honestly don't get why Nook is shifting its focus away from food to expand their coffee selection. I could (and do) go to any of the 15 cafÃ©s on the Ave for coffee. If I want an Americano or fancy latte, I'll go to one of those places (which, I should add, don't take 15 minutes to make a single coffee). Like most other people, I go to Nook for the amazing biscuits, not the coffee. I would be happy if they just went back to having only drip coffee - at least that would be ready by the time my food arrived rather than 5 minutes after I finished eating. I was also really disappointed to see that they took my favorite dish, the Nook Biscuits and Gravy with brie cheese and mushroom gravy, off the menu. Because the wait has gotten so bad and the food options are so much more limited, I probably won't be back for some time. 

The only reason I'm giving Nook even 3 stars is because the owner is super friendly, and the biscuits are still just as delicious as before. But please Nook - stop trying to turn into a cafe and put the focus back on the food - it was great how it was. I'd happily go back in a heartbeat if you brought back the expanded menu and switched back to drip coffee!"
1326549,Best steakhouse in Seattle. Staff goes out of their way to give guests a wonderful experience.
1720244,"The skirt steak tacos and ribs were delicious. The tacos are not your typical Mexican tacos, but they had an amazing combination of flavors. We would definitely go back."
2516063,"A little pricey for what its worth. Nice ambiance, seems like a after work dinner place, lots of professionals here when we went in the evening.  Drinks are good. Service is great just was not impressed.
Food was alright. We had the Steak and the steak was lacking flavor. Probable will not be going back. Sorry about the short review, just don't have much to say about this place."
1898276,"The service, quality and creativity of dishes, and ambiance is spectacular at Rock Creek! Much of the staff is made up of seasoned industry professionals, and the freshness of the menu items is quite impressive! Yum!"
854531,"Heard the hype, we decided to give it a try. Went on a busy Friday evening and got the worst table in the house, just little uncomfortable stools, no chairs at this table. Party of 3, ordered drinks and apps up front. Drinks were OK, appetizer sampler was pretty good. I ordered the Seafood stew, forget what is was called, but was just ok. Mostly clams, 1 chunk of salmon and 2 scallops. Overall, forgetful dinner and a good bit overpriced for the meager portions served. Will not return."
806540,"This place is great. Their food is delicious and very low priced. Staff is always nice. The owner is the nicest lady and loves when I bring my dog. She always gives her a strip of bacon :) so needless to say, my dog is always excited when we swing by here to pick up food on the way home. 
Oh, just don't go here if you are looking for a place to sit on a rainy day. Their seating is outdoor so I recommend coming on a sunny day or on a day when you want to eat at home."
692258,"Came on a Friday afternoon for happy hour.  Happy hour is from 2-6.  It wasn't that busy when I first arrived, but there was a birthday celebration soon after so the place got filled up fast.  

Drinks: I just had a couple red sangrias and it was decent.

Food:  The roast beef slider wasn't so good.  The meat tasted processed to me and I wasn't fond of the over excessive aoili.  The mini burger sliders were good though & I don't even like blue cheese.  Also liked the fries with aoili.  The dates with goat cheese were surprisingly decent.  I wasn't sure how that was going to pan out & was a bit reluctant to try.

Bathrooms:  The ladies room was clean but unfortunately I'm height challenged standing at 5 ft 2 in tall and had to tip toe to see myself in the mirror just so I could reapply my lipstick."
786153,"This place is pretty freakin' good.  Vegan options, cider, and not a bad Pimm's Cup."
698036,"I am giving this place 3-star for below reasons:
- They are always crowded. Seating for 2 people take 25min or more on weekend
- No fresh stir fried noodles where they do it on the spot
- Dessert is limited comparing to Bluefin. And it's always dirty
- Somewhat getto when people jumping in line and grabbing lobsters on weekend. There was a lady standing behind the lobster to make sure nobody takes more than 5 pieces!!
- Little expensive for South Center area and buffet in general. If they make this $19/person, it's more worthwide.
- Oysters are pretty much never available
- Icecream are hard to get (frozen and you have to reach your hand into the buckets)

Now the good parts:
- Most food are good. They have snow crab AND lobster on weekend. Nobody does this around Seattle area.
- Got chocolate fountain
- Steaks are good

I am not a sushi person so there isn't much for me at this place. I would go back for the lobsters but that's about it."
422484,"I can't say this review isn't written with a smidge of nostalgia. This was a super common destination during my high school days, whether it be lunch or a stop after school. 

And I'll say what I've always said - better than In & Out. Always and forever. I love their simple cheeseburgers, their chocolate milkshakes, and even their soda seems to taste better than anywhere. Probably too much sugar. 

But let's not forget the fries - anytime I've come home & requested we stop at Dick's my dad/brother refuse an order. I always get two because inevitably those two will find their way into the fry bag and plunder my gold. I love a squishy, limp fry and Dick's delivers. 

I will say I'm tempted to detract a star due to one, consistent, annoying, irritating, (insert more adjectives relating to annoyance) trait in ALL their workers. You hand them a $10 for a burger, fries (like $4) - ""do you have anything smaller""? NO. You hand them a $20 for an $13 order - ""do you have anything smaller?"" NO. NO AND NO. But I guess that'd seem trite, and Dick's I do love you."
906489,"The food here is much less sweet and a bit less salty as the average Thai place in the area. Even the salad rolls were a bit distinct with a a tougher (almost tortilla like) wrap. 

It seems other people have commented on the decor and mentioned that it was quiet. I believe it could be quiet if people are talking very quietly, but if the volume raises above the ""the movie is about to start"" whisper/talking then it's all over. When we were last there about 12 people were in their dining room and it was hands-down the loudest dining experience outside of a bar that either my friend and I have had in Seattle. Why is this? There is absolutely no sound dampening in the entire dining room. It is a small living room of an old house with bare walls, bare wood floors, and wood furniture. We are there for the food and conversation, not to provide a new space for Mutt Lang to mic a snare drum. For the sake of future diners - I beseech the owners to hang up some tapestries, curtains or at least a rug... 

Pros: Some variety in flavors for Seattle Thai

Cons: Noise"
1684658,"Our service left MUCH to be desired!  The quality of the steak was fantastic, but it was very undercooked.  The potatoes were whipped, not mashed.  The food was luke-warm at best.  We asked the server to dim the lights to create a better atmosphere, but our requests were ignored.  The seating is not romantic or comfortable. The dancers were mediocre."
2445254,"Eh, the food was ok, nothing to get excited about. What really upset me was the poor customer service. The waitress gave us a dirty look when we asked to sit at a table instead of the bar. She then proceeded to ignore us while she served those around us. I started to assume she wasn't our waitress; however, after taking drink orders and bringing out bread to the people next to us (who arrived at the SAME time as us) she finally came by (5-10 min later) with just water (no bread or butter) - STILL did not take our order. I got the feeling she just didn't want to serve us, though I don't know why. 

I know they're a small eatery and probably focus more on the locals; however, my husband and I recently moved here and their extremely poor customer service was upsetting. We will NOT be returning."
272892,I LOVE FRENCH STYLE BAKERIES and this place recently penetrated my heart. The Double Baked Almond Croissant is simply the best and I think I want another one right this second! The only downside is the calories but these calories are delicious in comparison to your grocery store bakery.
813703,"While doing the tourist thing at the Space Needle, lunch rolled around and I knew one thing: I did not want any of the food at the Needle. So, a friend and I strolled down the street and came across Golden Singha. 

I ordered the Garlic Delight with Tofu and had a spring roll as well.  The spring roll was average. Nothing special.  The waiter asked how hot I wanted the tofu and I got the 2nd spiciest, which I think was 3 or 4 chili peppers on the menu guide.  Yes....nice and spicy!  Mix it in with a bit of rice, and just wonderfully spicy and filling.  The service was ok, nothing spectacular, but the food was good!"
193265,"Have to give a 5 star just for their BIG and EASY sauce. For anyone who loves garlic and shrimps will love this place. Whether its crab or the gulf shrimp, both taste phenomenal in their house sauce. The sides of fried okra, andouille sausage, corn, potatoes and garlic bread with the shrimp make a fantastic meal. 
To finish things off the best way beginets make a perfect dessert. The staff is friendly and the ambience is unique. By far my favorite cajun place in Seattle, its worth the money!!!"
998372,Traveling on business and saw this unique restaurant for breakfast. Ambiance of as great. Food tasty nice large portions. Would recommend.
255034,"Not gonna lie, I only come here for HH.

I've been here a handful occasions and from what I remember their regular menu was great. With the amount I eat out, totally out of budget. Thank goodness for me they have happy hour twice a day, and a damn good one.

Their HH menu is pretty large compared to other restaurant and pretty much everything is good. I really like the mussels, smoked salmon, baked brie, crab dip, and $3 or $4 drafts. Most dishes range from $3-$10 with couple exceeding that, but the portions/quality are very good for the price

Great place for after work, and probably one of the best views in tacoma. Don't miss out!"
837932,"Nice people, decent pie, nothing to rave about except the location, which is excellent for access to the 4th of July festivities. Luckily we arrived at 6, and got a table right away. 15 minutes later the line was deep."
885506,The food and service was outstanding.
1951338,I just ate there for the first time. I had the tagliatelle with butter and Parmesan (a sauce offer everyday with your choice of noodles from the board) as well as some marinated green olives. Pasta was perfectly cooked! Will be returning soon.
941258,"Going back some 10+ yrs ago, where they used to make the sausages where today it's a dining room.  Uli the man the myth, the legend himself would be in the kitchen to help out with sales, cooking, or overseeing the sausage making.

Today, there is a small dining room off to the side, which used to be a kitchen for making the sausages.  The right side has the glorious case full of sausages of all kinds with influences from all parts of the globe.  They can cook up for you too anything in the case as a ""sausage Sandwich,"" with a number of different toppings.  I prefer kraut and mustard myself.

Now thinking back to what it was then, to what it is now.  I miss the old Uli's Famous Sausage.  Its lost its luster.  There is a certain quality missing from it all.

Too little salt, to tightly packed and too finely ground up.  I'm just not enjoying it like I used to, where I would go each week down 7 blocks for a sausage sammy.  Now I want something more rustic and artisinal, more flavor.  I'm sorry Uli, I've been seeing someone else for my sausage fix."
823849,"I don't know why I find it so strange that one of the most fantastic restaurants on earth is located in Spokane.  Perhaps it is because Mizuna is across the street from the most bleak-looking Macy's I've ever seen.   But nothing I have tasted at this outrageously good restaurant has been less than fabulous, and it is all so fresh and healthy-not to mention locally sourced and organic. Mizuna makes my top 5 list of best restaurants anywhere, ever.

I highly recommend the Grilled Ahi Tuna Sandwich: a truly delectable piece of grilled Ahi tuna on fresh Ciabatta bread with peppercorn aioli, housemade olive tapenade, thinly sliced roma tomatoes, and organic greens. 

This has to be the most mind-blowingly delicious tuna sandwich on earth.  When made with quality ingredients, fish sandwiches are almost invariably tasty--but this sandwich is a notch above even the best fish sandwich I have tried. I'm not always a fan of rare tuna on bread - I don't always find the textures to be complimentary - but the combination of these two ingredients is one of the most addictive things about this amazing little sandwich. The Ciabatta is freshly made, buttery, grilled and flavorful, and both crunchy and soft at the same time. The tuna is flavourful and such an exquisite texture, neither chewy nor dry but soft and heavenly-seriously, the chef had to have been paying attention down to the second.  The aioli gives the sandwich just a hint of peppercorn, and the tapenade is complex and delicious.  The result is that every time your teeth sink into this juicy sandwich you are treated to an array of incredible flavors and textures that make it impossible to put down until you are finished."
791135,"I don't know what all the negative fuss is about.  This is pretty damn close as you can get to laid back, good homey southern atmosphere as you can get in Seattle.  Too lazy or fussy to bus your own table?  Get over yourself or go someplace else, but you'll be missing out.  The staff is extremely nice and make it clear where to get what you want and need when you order at the counter in the back.  I grew up in the south and have struggled to find good places for southern food that also have the charm to match.  This place works well enough for me.

Now to the food.  Absolutely great!  The eggs and hash combos my mates got were delicious.  My oyster po'boy was better than many I've had in NOLA, though not better than the best, of course. :P  The pecan pie was perfect.  Thick slice.  Not overly sweet like a lot of places make them.  Rich flaky crust.  They serve good Cafe Vita coffee too.  I look forward to getting some biscuits in the future."
809844,Amazing fry bread tacos! Large portions for cheap prices! The cinnamon sugar fry bread was an excellent drunken dessert too!
1339961,"So the consensus is this a good pizza place to hit up after bar hopping which is true! I used to go during lunch in college because it is so dang cheap and the slices are huge. The classic cheese is what I would usually get. Its definitely thin and greasy. I do prefer softer crust personally, theirs is a little tough for me. I also have found they could have have slightly friendlier staff. But overall a place I will continue visit during a night of boozing and cruising the hill."
882468,"Very nice employees! Great cheese samples!! Mac (Penne) and cheese was ehhh good.  It wasn't like mac and cheese to me, the sauce was soooo runny, the penne were over cooked.  It still tasted good..."
863625,"Overpriced and bad (lack of) service.

Visited Volunteer Park CafÃ© again on the 4th prior to visiting the SAAM nearby at Volunteer Park. As far as eatery options nearby, there are none within a 3-4 block radius of VPC. So it owns the area that it is located in.

Stopped by to pick up some lunch. Ordered some meat quiche, a sugar & salty cookie and a cup of tea. And paid for it. But only got the first and last item. So over $15 for a piece of quiche and tea. They completely forgot about the cookie. At first, I thought they may have thought that I wanted salad on my quiche and charged for me for that. But that doesn't appear to be the case as salad comes standard with it.

I think the way they are setup as far as stations is the reason for this. The cashier was not the one to provide me with everything. Instead, another person served me my tea and another person served me my quiche. With a setup like this, it is no wonder my order was messed up.

I still like the food, but it is quite overpriced. There wasn't much competition in the 15th Ave so it was fine, but now that places like Bakery Nouveau have moved in. It has become more evident. If Bakery Nouveau can offer sandwiches for under $8, this place should too.

I am still at odds with the no frills service. You kind of feel cheated paying the usual service tip on overpriced food here. Also, I wish they would put price tags on the baked goods and label what the teas contain. The cashier could not name the ingredients in the tea. 

I had to do the eye and smell (my nose was stuffed) test when she gave me the jar to smell to figure out what I wanted. Hard to know what Harmony tea is supposed to be for the average person. I might have to just go to Remedy next time if I am in this part of the Hill and looking for tea.

Given there are more options that are similar to VPC nearby, particularly Bakery Nouveau, I think I will steer clear of this place from now on. Overpriced food and no frills service is not a winning combination."

2196791,"I found this little gem by searching on Yelp, and trusting the positive reviews. Boy, was it a good choice! Lengthy review follows, so for the short version: Worth a visit, respect the effort this chef and staff puts into your experience and you will NOT be disappointed. Small dishes, but so nurturing.

I came here with my mom and boyfriend on a visit down from Vancouver. We all have different tastes in food, so I was nervous about everyone being satisfied. However; the food, decor, ambience, and service were so impeccable that I can't imagine any type of person coming here and being disappointed.

I am a vegetarian and had the baked egg dish. It was small but just right for my hunger level and so thoughtfully put together. The ingredients are high quality and fresh, so you can really enjoy the individual flavours.

My mom is a meat and potatoes gal and had the vegetable lasagna. She really enjoyed it, but what was amazing was that she LOVED the arugula salad. She hates arugula and she would not shut up about that salad!

My boyfriend likes home cooking and got a breakfast dish. He complained that he hadn't gotten the lasagna since he tried my mom's and said it was the best he ever had. He also complained to me that his breakfast was plain and pricey, but I pointed out the handmade sausage, the thick butcher style bacon, the artisan-looking toast, etc. He agreed it was pretty phenomenal after thinking about the ingredients more, but he was still jealous of that lasagna!

We all split the sangria sorbet. MotherHubbard, was it good! Kudos chef!!! My mom was going on and on about the pistachio cookie and asked the waiter if she could buy one to take home. He gave her a little baggie with EVERY cookie they had there. It made her feel so special, and we all raved about how friendly people are in Seattle. The proprietor, Paul, even greeted us on the way out, and gave us some tourist tips! 

Thank you, Tilikum for adding another memory to our amazing vacation, and helping to shape our opinion that Seattle is home to some of the most genuine and artistic people in the world."
970965,"The chicken pho was just so-so, the little dish of hoisen, chili, and ginger was a welcome addition. The fact they offer VENISON, ALLIGATOR, and giant SNAILS has me so excited to return. Wish I had read more of the menu before I ordered. Definitely returning for these unusual offerings."
2628373,"The food is excellent, the servers are great.  The hostesses/hosts could definitely be better.  My 3 person family waited well over and hour for a table when they said it would be 30 minutes.  While we waited, we watched several groups of people be seated (that did not have reservations) that arrived quite a while after us.  That was very frustrating.  The attitude of the hostesses didn't help either."
1109810,"I just had dinner at Dinette and it was amazing!! I had the dates, pork butt and butter lettuce salad.. Shared with my husband and it was absolutely delicious. We are visiting from our of town and I think I could eat there every day!"
1896848,"I've been to this Red Robin about 4 times in the last year.  It's not my first choice among dining opportunities in the Northgate area (mainly because I'm not a big fried food fan, burger fan, or lactose fan anymore).  Often, when I go there it's for some sort of social gathering.   Last week, it was for a birthday.  

I like that there is easy access both from the parking lot and the mall.  It's also nice to easily be able to walking right through the restaurant but you do so at your own risk and the walkway is often crowded with staff, strollers, food trays and what not.  

Customer service is okay.  Once, I got terrible service as I stopped in to pick up a takeout order for someone else.  I got shuffled around the place 3 times before I finally put my foot down and said, ""Where do you want me to sit to wait for my food?  Just tell me and that's where I'll go.""  It was an infuriating experience.  The manager on duty, was very helpful, willing to hear my story, and gave me a gift card for my trouble.  I let a significant amount of time go by before I went back.  

If you like onion rings, bottomless fries, and a host of other fried snackables, this is the place for you.  I'm not a big fan of french fries but for some reason, I can't stop eating these when they're set down in front of me.  Sauces?  They got you covered.  Want a burger?  Perfect.  They have burgers.  I like the taste of their meat but find the buns lean toward the soggy side, particularly when soaked in the grease of said burger.  I love the thickness of the bacon!  They also have tons of lactose evil there ranging from milkshakes to sundaes to smoothies.  

Children appear to be addicted to the mac and cheese.  I'm not a big fan as it's a bit on the watery side for my taste.  I like the cheese a little less like soup.  

Oh, is it your birthday?  Well, have a birthday sundae!  Just in case, they'll sing a song to make you feel special and draw the attention of tables nearby.  

On my last visit, it was about $38 for three adults and a child without tip.  That's not bad.  The food wasn't bad.  I just can't eat bacon and drink shakes all day like I used to so I don't willingly visit very often.  It is a bit of a guilty pleasure so complain as I may, a part of me enjoys it."
320036,"Awesomely good

Just had dinner here. I had the taco plate - 3 soft tacos (one chicken, one beef, one pork - you can choose your own combos) and my partner had an extravagant burrito. The salsas were incredibly delicious. The tortillas for the tacos were home-made tasting. The fillings themselves were outstanding. This is my new favorite taqueria. Hands down. 
One reviewer said they were 'overpriced.' Maybe he's been buying his tacos at Nordstrom. TNT's prices are right in line with pretty much every other taco joint in town. 
Go here. Eat food. Leave happy."
859683,"Nice restaurant. The pink door pretty much indicates that you've come to the right place. Indoor dining seems to be on the more formal side; outside it's a bit more casual, but with a great view of the water if you happen to be faced that way. 

Good service all the way around. I made a reservation, but they were a few minutes late in honoring it, but that's okay. Sat at the bar for a while, they have 3 or 4 beers on draft. Food is decent. Huge plate of clams and mussels for $19. Most plates are $15-20 each.

Recommended if you're in the Pike Market area."
771510,"It's official, I am now addicted to Kale thanks to Veggie Grill's delicious All Hail Kale salad! (Agave roasted walnuts.. yumm).. their chili was good as well. I would not recommend their mac and cheese though, one bite and I could see why my youngest wouldn't eat it.. :P The server was nice enough to switch it out for a burger - thumbs up to good service!

Because the food is wholesome and less processed, it's very filling! 

A note of caution, their sweet potato fries are dangerously addicting :)"
238884,"This is quite possibly my favorite Thai restaurant in the Seattle-metro area. I would even go as far as to put it into my top 10 restaurants in general. I love this place's food so much.

Don't mind me as I just list off all of the food that I always order when I'm there: spring rolls, crab delight, coconut prawns, chicken phad thai, fried trout, and most importantly, the phad kee mao, which is the most bomb phad kee mao you will ever eat in your life."
1515795,"i used to come to this place when it was a Quizno, but stopped coming, because i`m not into lamb. but i always walked by and tell myself that one day, i will goo! that day, finally came, last week when my co-worker bragged about how wonderful this place was. 

oh-em-gee, i`ve been missing out all these years! this place was awesome! (i`m still not into lamb, but they have chicken).  the bread was super good. but i have to warn you though, this is probably not a place to bring a date. it can get really messy."
822625,"This is a really great place to get yourself a gyro.  I've only been here once, but I got outstanding friendly service and a meat loaded lamb gyro!!!  The guy at the counter was super nice and gave me a free cup of tea when I told him my car had a flat tire around the corner.  The lamb gyro was only $6 after tax and what I received was, to my suprise, packed full of tender and savory meat along with the right amount of juicy vegetables and sauce.  I will be coming here again the next time i get a hankering for a gyro, shawarma, or falafel."
1643966,"Not happy last Friday when I took my Groupon to Root Table on the last day of validity.  I rushed through traffic  to get there by 3pm, since the website said open for lunch till 3pm.  Walked in at 2:45 and was told last call for lunch was at 2;30.  Said to come back when they opened for dinner at 4.  
Keeping the customer happy goes a long way.  I will not be back."
2156133,"Filthy. I mean it. Last time I was there the tables were covered with ancient gook. The waitress came and wiped the table with a dirty rag but it didn't touch the old, stuck on stuff. The wings are tasty but not crunchy and you can't ask for them to be that way. Mostly, it's the dirt that keeps me away. Ew."
1454354,Was a little skeptical because it looks like a hole in the wall but those are usually the best places.  And this is definitely one of those places.  Very sweet owners!  The food was amazing.  We got the mushroom burger and the bacon cheeseburger and they were amazing!!! And that's saying a lot because I LOVVVEEE burgers!!! Lol not to mention the fries and onion rings were on point.  All for under $20!
1180948,"Beats iHop (ew) in price and portions! I'm a big fan. You can substitute hash browns with breakfast potatoes, which I HIGHLY recommend. Tasty! The price range is pretty standard with it being about $9 an entree. I've been here twice and ordered (the best) biscuits and gravy both times. Delicious! Next time I'll branch out and be adventurous with trying something else off the menu. I may update my review based on the findings, but so far my luck has been really good. :)"
168285,"It's a Starbucks...but it isn't.  This is hands down one of the go-to meeting places on the hill.  Much cozier than Vivace, and while it doesn't have the amazing coffee quality the nearby competitor does, they do have beer, wine and the standard flavor of Starbucks (which we've all grown accustomed to)."
885338,"I have given this place several tries and I really want to like it but just can't win. I went in there tonight with my wife. We both ordered the New York Strip medium rare. The food came out at a decent time but both of our steaks were Medium well. I figured if your at a place that offers steak they damn well better know how to cook a steak. Its not rocket science, especially when you are paying nearly $30 for a piece of meat. The sides, the asparagus was all soggy and limp the potatoes were pretty good but there only was maybe 4 bites of them. 
On top of it all the server asked how everything was. I told him my steak was good but med well not med rare, he snapped at me and ask if I wanted it re-fired. I politely declined and was about to say I just wanted to let him know as he stormed off and to resurface until it was time for the check. Poor service, mediocre food, if they are busy they will seat you at a table so close to the next one you will feel like you are on a double date. Not going back."
1952502,"I ordered the salmon, and it was an absolute trainwreck of a dish. Honestly one of the least appetizing things I've ever had.  It must have been cooked sous vide -- it was barely cooked, totally pink, and utterly flavorless. Disgusting consistency.  Garnishes were ill conceived, contributed nothing. 

I had a bite of my friends smoky beans, and if I had that I would have had a slightly different attitude.  But my food sucked. 

The real take away point was the inept service, from beginning to end.  When they weren't ignoring us they were saying stupid things, recommending too many dishes, and utterly failing to keep the front door closed. My wife got up and closed it maybe 20 times during our meal, after people walked in and sat down. During that time, the staff closed it a grand total of zero times.  They also failed to bring us our coats.  We had paid (exorbitantly) and stood there waiting  for someone to come notice us, maybe just bring our coats without our asking. 

Oh yea, your freaking door is broken. Considering the next sentence, you better freaking fix it. 

Food and a couple glasses of the cheaper wine @ $100 a head. So not worth it. Not worth a third of that."
825775,"My husband and I dined here on the first day of Seattle Restaurant week. It was a great experience. The service was great and the food was awesome! I personally felt that 3 courses for $28 is worth it!

This was what I had -

Warm bread while waiting for our food. We also chose the wine pairing for each course at $18. 

First Course: Caramelized Carrot Soup: braised celery, fried Walla Walla onions, micro mirepoix

~It was a cold and rainy evening so the soup was the perfect warm up for dinner. Yummy! Soup was sweet and creamy. Great comfort food! 

Second course: Grilled Albacore Tuna: confit tomatoes, smashed marble potatoes, sweet basil emulsion and candied olives

~It looks small BUT it really fills you up! Tuna was fresh and tasted really good with the sweet basil pesto. Wish there was more pesto on my plate :D

Third course: Cream Cheese Huckleberry Bread Pudding: white chocolate Chantilly, huckleberry compote, and candied almond slivers

~Dessert!!! My favorite! I Love the bread pudding. It is not too sweet, the huckleberry sauce is delicious - i think the sweetness and sourness evens out nicely!


---------
Yes! i would totally recommend this place. In fact, I think that it's a must go for Seattle Restaurant week. ohh... It's a lovely place to bring your date for dinner ;D 

[The only thing I didn't like was.... I made my reservation via Opentable and it was not eligible for dinning points. Wonder why was it so?! Bummer! ]"
878255,"First, full disclosure: I'm not from Washington so the quality of sushi I'm used to might be a bit below average.  That said, I thought the sushi here was delicious.  I also don't really know what the average price for sushi is in this area, but I thought the prices were very reasonable.  Highly recommended."
175969,"This visit was my second Restaurant Week dining experience at Staple & Fancy and I must say, I was much more impressed this year.   As before, the meal starts off with a series of small plates.  House made mozzarella with bottarga shaved over the top, a light mixed green salad, pork prochetta, octopus and chickpea salad and my favorite, the smoked Arctic Char and Mackerel crostini which was knock your socks off fantastic!  

For the entree I had braised pork cheeks with creamy white polenta and broccoli rabe.  The pork was extremely tender and, well...porky goodness!  The pork with the polenta was almost too rich but the portion was just right.  Room for dessert?  How about their incredible ricotta cheesecake with blueberries and lemon curd?  Delish for sure but the test of The Wife's chocolate gelato had me second guessing.  

Service was top notch and attentive.  The server knew that The Wife was a pescatarian so in difference to me having all the prochetta, she sent over an anchovy on a hard boiled egg with ailoi.  A very nice touch that was rewarded.

The wine list has a good selection at different price points and the decor is quaint.  A pleasant meal at a bargain price."
1132701,"This place has an amazing view. Great relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff. The customer service was outstanding. Probably some of the most friendliest staff that we have met. Smiles everywhere you went. It came out to about $60 dollars for the wife and I to eat brunch. Pretty cheap for the great service and delectable food. The waiter kind of forgot about us, but once we asked for our drinks once more he came back frequently. 

They have themes here and this weeks theme was Hawaiian. Now that might sound off putting to those who want a traditional brunch buffet. They have just that as well. They had an omelette bar, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, French toast, and crepes. Along with that they had Hawaiian tasting food. Delicious chicken and other plates I cannot do justice to with words. Great food. Great place. Definitely going again in the near future."
2628425,"UPDATE:  Do you like Norovirus?  Me either... and this lovely place gave it to me.  My buddy and I shared one of the ""Feasts"" that they pour on the table, and we both contracted the Norovirus, also known as the Norwalk Virus!  I've been up for 12 hours vomiting with; diarrhea, muscle aches, fatigue, hallucinations.  NOT FUN!!  This is the same virus that makes entire cruise ships get sick... so I'm curious who else got sick here...  I cannot, and will not, ever return to this dreadful place.  Please read below for my actual dining experience (before i was sick).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay.  Let me be fair here right off the bat... I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food, the view, the experience of smashing everything with a wood mallet is a great time... but this last experience presented me with customer service far from acceptable, which they are only getting two stars.

Dustin, our server, showed promise out the gate.  Attentive, courteous, not overbearing, until it came to ordering drinks.  He judged my fiance when she was trying to decide between the ""Pint and the Liter"" beer.... specifically, he said ""the liter is really more than you need"".... I was shocked.  

Patrons at our table were then again judged when ordering chowder.... one person ordered a bowl so we could try it, and he was judged ""well that is a lot of chowder considering you are getting the feast!""  Unacceptable.

The biggest issue was our seafood feast.  Fantastic seafood, crab, mussels, clams, etc.  But about halfway through we noticed our feast had no potatoes .... we were bummed, so we let our busser know.  He went to let Dustin know.  Next thing you know, Dustin is charging up the stairs and dumps a huge bowl of potatoes on our neighbors table.  When we told him*our* feast was missing the potatoes, he said ""oh really?"" then the neighbors said, ""ou can take them back!""  Then right in front of us, Dustin yells to the other table ""No, it's okay, you eat them!""  Rude rude rude.

No discount on our bill, no trying the potatoes. Unacceptable experience from a crappy waiter ruins a good place.   I still recommend people trying this place, just don't get this waiter.... or clarify your desire for idaho suds! :P"
270878,"I had the number 2 (grilled onions, blue cheese) and added bacon.  The bacon was really not necessary because the onions and blue cheese were so flavorful and pretty much kept me from being able to taste the bacon.   

The only drawback this time was that there was too much liquid which made the bun a little soggy.  Much of this could have been mitigated if the restaurant would simply toast their buns so they don't soak up so much of the liquid.  In spite of that, the burger and fries were excellent and this is a great place for a burger in a town that I don't associate with good burgers.    The parking is free but the lot is really small so you're better off finding a place on the street (unless you don't care about getting your door dinged--I did not but I am sure it has happened to many people because the lot has about 25 spaces and really only has room for about 20).  Enjoy, good stuff.  Next time I am going to try the Philly Smash burger.  It  looks like a winner!!!  This review took place on the 26th of January."
817364,"Great spot.  Great lighting...good music.  Most importantly, good food and good time."
1022848,"If you're looking for the most authentic Mexican meal you've ever eaten, you probably shouldn't come here. The food here is good - don't get me wrong. Just don't go in with high expectations that this will be the best meal ever. 

I come here regularly and I almost always order the nachos - hard to mess up, I know, but still delicious every time. And the price can't be beat. I noticed that when they switched from Azteca to Don Eduardo's, they changed the menu a little and added a salsa bar. Cool! But I love the familiarity and cozy atmosphere here, which is why I still stick to the usual. 

The servers here are great for the most part. I've only had a couple off moments in all my years coming. And I am always entertained by the Waiter With The Extra Long Pinky Nail. What does he do in his off time?? Someday I will get up the courage to ask him, though I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who knows what the answer would be....

The food gets three stars and I'm throwing in the extra star for the nice servers and ambiance.  Maybe someday I'll get something besides the nachos that will blow me away. Nah, who am I kidding?"
1901761,Great place very attentive waitress. Food was up in less than 15 minutes.   We had the crazy monkey roll catipillar roll mixed tempura and edamame.  All was beautiful ly presented fresh and delicious.  Perfevt for two 33.00.  Will definitely come back.
817277,"Did I go on a bad night? 

We got a table right away, but it took at least 10 minutes for a server to even bring us menus. I  would understand if they were busy, but they were not. Looking around, I could see plenty of staff, but no one seemed terribly organized. The server was very nice, took our order for the food and drinks. We got our drinks right away, but waited 25 minutes for our order of garlic fries to show up....25 minutes for an order of fries?!?! I will give them credit for the garlic fries, they were very tasty.

 Then our wings showed up...wish they would have left them in the kitchen, or on the poor chicken. I know the menu says a pound of wings (precooked weight)..this was no where close to a pound. They were small, tasteless, limp and overall disappointing. I actually felt sorry for the chickens that gave up their wings, considering how this place served them.

Needless to say, first and last time for this restaurant."
1027959,"We went to Duke's on a Saturday afternoon and it was comfortably busy. We sat outside.

We had fish and chips and shared a bowl of their chowder. We also had iced tea and a cocktail. 

First of all, the food truly is divine and their home-made tartar sauce is delicious. They have rather large portions and nothing tasted pre-made or frozen. 

The drinks were fab! 

The wait staff is attentive and polite and is quick to anticipate your need.

My only tiny complaint is the outside decor: very, very dated and looks like cheap backyard furniture. It's a turn off to enjoy amazing food, great wait service and a lovely view from a plastic chair."
1947013,"i can't believe i never wrote a review for this place! i haven't been here in AGES for dinner so this review is strictly for dim sum (different chefs). i hadn't come here for dim sum in a while too actually. not because i don't like the place, it's just that it's ALWAYS jam packed! most dim sum spots have a prime time of about 11 - 1 ish. this place is jumping from 10 to 2:30 or 3! yikes. so it's crazy that i thought we could snag a seat for the five of us this past monday on prez weekend! but i'm actually not crazy cause i was rollin' with my folks and my folks are old school chinatown :) i dropped them off while i went to park the car so they could wait in line. i guess that was not necessary because by the time i got back to the restaurant from parking we had a seat already! how can that be? the line was out the freakin' door. shoot, you don't know my moms. the hostess saw her rollin' in and was all like ""oh! mrs ma, you're here for dim sum? how many? ok, right this way"" she didn't write no names in the book or nothing. she just had somebody clear off a big table for us and viola! hahaha. i love eating with my folks!!!! ok, so on to the food. we started with the staples: har gao, shiu mai, chicken feets, shrimp rice noodle wrap, scallop dumplings, tripe (book), stuffed green peppers x2, sticky rice wrapped in leave, tripe (honey comb), tofu skin wrapped pork, fried tofu skin wrapped pork/shrimp, and other stuff i'm forgetting. everything was fresh and very hot. i can see why with this kind of turn around it's not hard to keep things moving and that's the key to successful dim sum. you can't have stuff steaming in the carts indefinitely. the only misses in my opinion were the honey comb tripe. flavor and texture were not there. not nasty but compared to everything else it wasn't as good. what was a surprise to me was the level of service. sure, it's not like in richmond, bc where you have an individual captain but the push cart ladies and really all the staff were smiling and friendly, never surly - i know! crazy! still hands down the best dim sum in seattle in my opinion."
1447864,"I came back to this restaurant after a long absence and was so glad I did. They remodeled inside and have a new Chef and new things on the menu. Definitely does not fall under tourist trap like some of the other restaurants nearby. When we spoke with the manager they pointed out which ingredients came straight from the market next door and which Pike's Place vender to find them from! 
The seafood entrees were excellent and worth the price but the real hit were some of the sushi. We went back the next day for lunch!
The staff was wonderful and attentive and I loved the atmosphere. 
Go for dinner and enjoy the view of the Seattle waterfront!"
777540,"Highly recommend! 

On a visit to Seattle, we came for dinner and the cabaret show on Saturday night. We had made a reservation but ultimately ended up sitting and eating at the bar, which worked out well because we were close to the stage for the show. The food was excellent and the bartender was very accomodating. 

The best part of the visit was definitely the cabaret show. A little people watching is an added bonus too."
873731,"Way too expensive. Selection is decent but at the prices you could EASILY go to a very nice restaurant for the cost. Check out cheaper alternatives in the surrounding area.

I've changed my review from 1 star to 2 because the service is fine. I'd still highly suggest staying away if you don't want to spend $20 - $30/person for average sushi."
822258,This place is awesome! Fun waiters and yummy yummy food :D
979250,"The wings. That is really all I need to say. Large, just spicy enough to please without upsetting my stomach during lunch! We didn't love the pork tacos, but the manager was incredibly attentive and took care of it. The coconut shrimp are also a win. We will for sure be back!"
1004867,"There are so many other great restaurants in the area that really it is a waste of money to go to this place, and it is not cheap either!!!.  I used to be a super fan of their Seattle and Woodinville locations. They use to have something called Chicken in the Jungle that was simply amazing but they removed that item from the menu long time ago.  Their food now is mediocre and the service not much better.  

I find it really sad that Racha took the spot of Typhoon which was a great restaurant."
1159407,"I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but this place is excellent. I recommend the Thai Peanut Bowl or the THC sandwich with tempeh bacon. Yum. The staff is always very friendly and the service is prompt. I cannot recommend this place enough. The vibe is very welcoming and unpretentious."
790296,"It's pretty good. A little on the pricier side and I agree, service can be bad if you're eating a full meal in the bar, but eh whatever, sit upstairs. I'll be back. Crispy garlic chicken A+. The building is pretty too."
512955,"The food here is good and comes in extremely large portions! This place is especially good for large groups where you can share appitizers and do a ""round robin"" type dessert share to try their EXCELLENT desserts!"
421592,Awesome thin pizza and parking available in back
1448848,"Let me say this first I'm a huge fan of local businesses and soul food, so I was looking forward to trying this place. The first time I came here they were closed because their frier was down. This time I arrived at 11:30am, but the door was locked and it said they open at 11:00 on the door. I was about to leave, but decided to call to see when they were going to open. They said we are opening now, so I was very happy to get in especially since I drove from Tacoma. The food is pretty pricey compared to other places. Gumbo was $18.99 and most meals were at least $12.00. I ordered the spicey drumetts and I know they are drumetts, but they were the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen in my life. They looked like wings and legs off a baby chicken. Chicken was seasoned well and tasty, but soooo small. I had it with red beans and rice witch was probably the best part of the meal. Cornbread was good. Also ordered a small side of mac and cheese for $4.99 and it was only ok. My wife had chicken legs and waffles that was nothing special, only ok. The last surprise was the bill, $33.00 for the lunch. Oh yea also credit card machine was down so I had to walk to the bar next door and use their atm witch charged $2.50 for the transaction. So gas and $35.00 later I have to say I'm very disappointed. I hoped for so much more from this place, but I can't say I will be returning. The only upside is the people are very nice, but it doesn't make up for all the downsides."
799795,"Saw this place on Triple D on Food Network, decided to try it out since I lived in Seattle at the time... Was not impressed! Greasy, thin onion rings. They try and sell you on the tartar sauce because the onion rings have absolutely no flavor but oil! Disgusting, sloppy burger. Everything just falls out onto the plate. $3 medium tea. This place was overrated and over priced. I will gladly spend whatever amount on good food, but this place was a huge disappointment. I've had way better burgers, onion rings, elsewhere. I'm worried about the people that rated this place ""amazing."" Do they know what good food is, because I'm assuming they have no clue. Save your gas and money and check out other burger joints."
1113482,"I was in the area on Saturday and popped in here for lunch seeing as it had good reviews. It's quite funky and unassuming in the restaurant. You order at the counter and they bring you your order when ready. Although the staff was friendly, you immediately get the sense there is no flexibility on the menu as ""no substitutions"" and other such language is prominently displayed on the order and menu signage. I decided to go with the cutting board bento box and was disappointed that it was mostly all breaded and deep fried. I thought the food was ok - nothing too exciting, but then again I am not that into breaded and deep friend food. That said, it looks like they are most popular for their curry. I would have certainly ordered a veg curry as I don't eat beef, but all they have is beef and a sign that says they don't do veg curry. I assume they have written that sign up because they get a lot of people asking for veg curry. If so, it might be a good idea to add it to their menu? That might encourage me to give this place another try someday. For now, I will probably pass on returning here."
1914771,"One of the WORST experiences ever in regard to the food and the ""cocktail"" - in quotes because I don't think what I was served qualifies as one.  I started with an ""old-fashioned"" and I specifically asked it to be made in the regular way and not what they list on their menu as a ""specialty"" cocktail.  Sadly it showed up tasting like some bizarre drink that had lime in it - hello, old-fashioneds made the traditional way do not include lime or simple syrup which I also detected; it was to be made with Bullit rye, which was watered down.  They did serve it with one large ice cube which was nice, but the gynormous swirled lime peel as a garnish was not a welcomed addition.  I then ordered the ""painted hill burger"" and asked for it to be black & blue.  It was cooked medium well.  I asked for the fries crisp and they were so that was fine.  The service was okay, not great, not horrible.  I did not ask for corrections to their mistakes - it should have been handled correctly the first time.  One star - it gets what it deserves.

As to the fellow who labeled all people from Los  Angeles as tank-top-wearing hair transplants:  I'm a native of LA and wear neither a tank top nor hair transplants.  And while I like Seattle as a city very much, I would never trade Los  Angeles for it - especially considering the food if Frolik is some kind of example of it; I'm simply traveling here on business and I certainly hope that the rest of the ""natives"" are more friendly while they are taking my money for sub-par food and cocktails.  Yikes."
184830,"OMG....

The pastries, cakes and breads there reminded me so much of the patisseries in Paris.

The macaroon was good and very cheap I can't remember i have ever paid less than $2 for any of them in other places in Seattle!! Btw, Fauchon is always the BEST however it is alot more expensive.

This place sells cholocate as well, we tried a few pieces. All are very top quality and have very good flavor.  Similar quality to Recchiuti San Francisco but half the price.

Great find for us as we seldom go to West Seattle.

I want my next B-day cake there!!"
870605,"M'm m'm...go here, their soup dumplings are extremely succulent!"
1777092,"The wait and prices can never out weigh the food. 11pm on a Saturday is terrible. Screaming kids, 20 minute wait... I'm good."
811133,"We came for breakfast and both had lovely meals.  I had interesting sesame waffle with soysauge and marinated tofu (instead of eggs). BF had a large meal of artichoke tofu scramble.  The biscuits were awesome as well as the cashew gravy which was so creamy. Bravo!   It is refreshing to have staff knowledgeable about what is in fact vegan.  They were accommodating with substitutions without charging extra.  However, what continues to mystify me is why rice or soy milk is extra. Is it more expensive than organic cow's milk?  I know it isn't so why are vegans being punished by this? or how about patrons who are allergic to dairy?  

It makes no sense to me."
2481630,"Black Angus anywhere, anytime, any sserver, any entree is ALWAYS fantastic in my estimation and IS certainly well worth the coupons!!  So sad when they closed Crossroads, but now go to Federal Way on 320thand love it there!!  Send me your coupons, all you naysayers."
256644,"The food is delicious, the decor is snug and inviting, and the service, excellent! A great place for a date w/ your partner, friends, and/or family! I honestly couldn't ask for anything better. MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!! 

They recommend sharing dishes when ordering and we definitely took their advice for our dinner. We had dinner for my b-day in November (& b/c the menu changes often, the dishes I mention may not be offered when you visit) & we had two appetizers, two small plates,one large plate, and a dessert. 

The dishes I remember the most are: (appetizer) pickled smelt, (sm plate) kale salad w/ an amazing dressing that I'm still thinking about an entire month later, (dessert) almond flavored pie (that reminded me of a really delicate and rich Southern dessert called chess pie), and a (large plate) pork dish that tasted amazing! 

I wish I could remember more details, but honestly I was so enamored of all the flavors of the food that I just wanted to enjoy all the deliciousness, HA! 

Our total bill was about $90 and we had one glass of wine, and a bottle of mineral water. It was WELL WORTH every dollar we spent."
986422,"Great retro ambiance. A little dark at night. The nachos and Mac n cheese are top notch! Definitely the best Mac n cheese in Seattle but as they say on the menu, it's piping hot so be careful!"
158236,"If you love Vietnamese food (which I do), and you love Tamarind Tree (which I do), and love affordable nosh (which I definitely do), and like not having to wait to get in (SEAT me, FEED me!)... then Long's Provincial Vietnamese Restaurant is totally your place! The food is always spot on, and the service is pretty good (it would be spectacular, save for the English barrier which often gets in the way). 

The spring (fresh) rolls are delicious, the short ribs are spectacular, and their vermicelli platters are delicious. You're gonna like it, boss!"
939200,"The plusses:
Fairly generous portions

That's about it. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good and it was exceptionally greasy, even for chinese food. The fried rice was decent, the egg rolls were dismal, the orange chicken was decent, the General Tso chicken was at the low end of acceptable for me, personally. 

We had this to go, ate a plate each at home and then tossed the rest; it was a waste of 35 bucks if I'm being honest. I should have had a local thai place deliver. I haven't tried everything on the menu, so it's possible I picked the 4 worst entree's on the menu, but I doubt it."
889534,"Warm not hot coffee, ALWAYS STALE BRITTLE DRY cookies, and indifferent staff (who say ""hmmm oh well"" when stale brittle dry cookies are mentioned)."
1446284,"Good selection, fresh taste, decent pricing, good service.  Every time I come I N'joy my visit."
175964,"I caught Skyfall (mighty good Bond film by the way) at Cinebarre and really enjoyed myself.  The seats were comfortable enough, the picture quality was alright and the food was surprisingly tasty and you can have a beer while you watch!

I had the classic burger (hold the cheese) with fries along with a bowl of popcorn to hold me over until the burger arrived.  When the server brought out the burger I didn't have much hope for it because the patty looked like a thin hockey puck.  It came with all the trimmings so I piled them all on but things fell down when I noticed there was no mustard on the counter!  No mustard?!!  Not wanting a dry burger I went for the ketchup and hoped for the best.  Well guess what?  That burger was pretty darn tasty!  One of the better burgers I've had in a while.  The fries were a bit meh though.  Popcorn?  Good.  The service was surprisingly good as well.  A well oiled service machine.

Why not 5 stars?  A bunch of little things really.  No place to put your coat (hooks under the counter in front would be nice).  No mustard or mayo served with the burgers.  Not enough space on the table/counter.  Still, it is a great way to see a movie!"
1949531,"The food and drinks here are phenomenal.  I went with a friend who enjoyed the spiciest margarita she's ever had (and even garnished with a jalapeno!)  I had the Papas con Rajas.  It was one of the most delicious things I think I have ever eaten.  It was rich and flavorful and just so delicious.  

Fantastic place with fantastic food.  And the servers are all super nice, too.  I'm going to be dreaming about those papas for a while...."
868189,"Awesome place!  I've been in three times now and everything I've bought from them has been good.  So much meat, so many hot sauces, hooray!  Plus, they've had a few choice items, one of which I've not been able to find anywhere else in Seattle, that pushes their rating to 5 stars.  They've got a great sense of humor, too, including some gross Halloween goods in the meat cases!"
973054,"Free valet parking to start was a nice touch, followed by a witty and helpful host. 

We started with a Napa Valley Cabernet which was reasonably priced and very tasty. Our appetizers were the special soup of the day - Moroccan chicken and rice along with the orange prawns which were recommended by our waiter. The soup was pretty good, but a wee bit bland. On the flip side - the shrimp we're bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked, so those disappeared very quickly!

Our main courses were the special of the evening - King Salmon, and the duck. While the salmon was cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly, the beans it came with were under-cooked and fairly hard. The duck was to die for. It was extremely flavorful, the Parmesan cream sauce is very rich and satisfying, and the duck was cooked to perfection. 

We were too full for dessert but will be returning soon because they had some amazing sounding options like a molten lava cake and pistachio ice cream.

The waiter was super friendly and the atmosphere was nice, so I am hoping to return and be able to upgrade this review to a 5 star because the menu has great potential!"
839051,"Definitely not worth it. News flash for the management: the near-frozen beer gimmick may work in other parts of the country, but in the Northwest where people actually have a clue about beer...not so much.

Combine that with the mediocre food, brainless staff, and wafts of scorched food emanating from the kitchen and you have a pretty crummy combination. 

For good beer, just drive the extra 5 minutes to Pine Lake Alehouse."
1890728,"Their special was pretty good overall although definitely not the best indian food I have had. 1 special, 1 naan, 1 rice for $24 is a bit expensive in my view"
2559970,"Really good and fresh tasting, I got the Curry Fried Rice and it was great...the tofu and the eggplant were cooked well and they brought out the flavor of the veggies. My boyfriend got the Pad Thai, I tried it and it was delicious! Good food and quick service."
1144049,"To be fair, it was RW day one but it wasn't that busy.

There was a lot of standing around being done by the kitchen. Two cooks were just dinking around for a good half hour. Really strange for an upscale kitchen. 

Food was solid but there were just so many strange elements to our experience. 

I had the panzanella salad which was tasty but 80% croutons. The sunchoke soup was very tasty. 

The lamb entree had good flavor but was cold by the time it got to our table. Meat and veggies were cold. 

One of our dining companions had the same entree and his was warm so I know it was a screw up. 

We did tell the owner who came around checking in that the dish was cold. He apologized and gave me a replacement promptly which was good. 

The pumpkin pie dessert and the walnut cake with chai ice cream and vanilla foam were interesting and tasty. I'm not sure I can get behind the foam thing but it was something unique to try. The vanilla flavor was detectable but there was literally no substance. 

The server also dropped a butter knife on my friend. It was an accident but he didn't even apologize. It landed in her lap. What if it were a steak knife? I'm sure he was embarrassed. That was just strange though.

One of our friends' orders was messed up, too. Brought the wrong entree. My friend kept it though.

The space is wide open and modern but a bit cold feeling. We left with a mixed impression. I won't be running back but I'm glad we went. 

If going by food alone the cold lamb and wrong order are forgivable. I would go with a 4 there. With the other elements considered I have to go with a 3."
1944512,"I'm not sure if this is the best chowder. But it did have alot of flavor. I sampled the Seafood Bisque and that was more tasty. It was the first I've ever seen a Seafood Bisque. I think if I was to go there again, I would try the seafood bisque.

This is located in the alley way of Pikes, it was a little tough to find. 

Went there Saturday morning around 11am and there wasn't a line. I was expecting there to be a long line."
883893,Blackboard Bistro is a favorite favorite favorite! Everything is always innovative and delicious. We like to go to a group and get a big variety. Check the Blackboard daily to see what will tempt your palate.
880973,"HH review: 

We wandered in here on a Monday evening for the all day happy hour. One of my friends was worried about being a little underdressed but no worries...no haters in here!

I'm going to start with my only criticism because I want to end this review on a positive note. Let's get it out of the way first: too dark! I realize this is what they were purposely going for, but personally, its a little much. Even Jazz Alley is more well lit.

I had a glass of red wine, the truffle cream soup and the escargot. The escargot was a typical garlic butter preparation but man was it good. The truffle cream soup was the real star here. I smelled the truffle as soon as he set it down. There were chunks of mushroom in here and it was so creamy, savory and earthy!! I highly recommend it.

As I mentioned earlier about ""no haters,"" I also want to note we had good service. When I went to the restroom, a waiter even came over and offered me his arm. He motioned for me to link arms and he would walk me to the rest room. Ummm how cute is that?!"
1651591,"Oh man, where can I start?! Coolest staff, and amazing food makes this my favorite spot in all of Tacoma!"
1126760,"Quaint spot on the edge of Capitol Hill inside a great local food barn. Troll the organic meat/cheese counters and wine bar before you get seated. Spot is elegant and peaceful. Like sitting at a table in grandmas farm house. It hammers home fresh food. Unique plates to share and unbelievable wine list. Ambiance complete with music on vinyl and staff who exude passion for the concept. Had butter/bread with sea salt, artisan cheese, salmon and local ham with kraut with a nice white. It will be a while before I stop talking about this place. Bravo."
1694492,"Service was extremely slow and not particularly friendly.  2 out of six meals were so badly prepared (over cooked) they were inedible.  (btw-do NOT get the fish and fries... omg bad)  The beef dip sandwich meat had sat in fluid so long steaming to keep it warm that all of the taste and color had leached out of it.  GROSS!  But we waited so long the first time around, we let them know, sent the food back and just let it go.  The other 4 people would have been long finished before the second attempt could have arrived.  

The manager was very gracious and I did not make a big deal about it, but after standing around for 35 minutes waiting to be seated, I had hope for more of their traditional quality which is frankly better by a long shot."
1280960,Great experience! Food and service are tops!  We'll be back!
870315,"You know when you see a little dude driving some insanely flashy car? You automatically assume that he is compensating for something, right?

Yep, that's how I feel about this place. The sushi is good, but there are places that are much more modest and you get more for your dollars.

If I don't remember what I got (which i don't) it's usually because it's not memorable or I drank too much (and I didn't).
No metaphors intended."
820666,"I like shopping here for one reason: it's in a mall. Whenever I am at Southcenter, I stop by Seafood City to stock up on snacks and drinks. What I like about this grocery store is that they always have something on sale. They also have a large selection of fresh seafood, a butcher, and  a deli section that would deep fry any fish you purchase. Also in their deli, you can find an oven roasted chicken and deep fried fish that is ready to eat. 

Overall, the convenience of picking up some dinner or a snack before a long day of shopping beats the idea of spending money on a single meal at the food court, which is a plus."
1332449,"While visiting Kirkland was looking for a Mexican food restaurant that served Texmex. Found this place on Yelp and the reviews were correct.

 Very friendly servers. Salsa and chips were good. Beer was cold.  And the meal was large portions and very good. 

Check it out!!"
1503397,"I hit this place on a Saturday night for a date. The decor is dim, cool, trendy, complete with a gigantic wall size portrait of the Fancy Feast cat! It was hard to talk about the decor with my date because the space is SO LOUD! It was very difficult to carry on a conversation, so much so I gave up and began nodding and smiling at whatever was being said. This approach was made easier due to Tallulah's wicked awesome cocktails! The G&T might be one of the best I have ever had! The twice baked sweet potato, cauliflower, and sardine with lentils were all fantastic small plates. Food, service, and cocktails make this a 4 star rating, but I probably won't go back unless I can find seats at the bar so conversation is easier. 

Pros
Cocktails are great
Awesome small plates (try the sardine and lentils)

Cons
LOUD!"
947079,"You really cannot go wrong here.  The staff is always friendly, and the food is fantastic. The sushi is fresh and creative, and the price is right.  A great neighborhood spot for lunch or dinner"

Been here a few times now and definitely be back for years to come!
TRY the BRISKET!!!!"
1945350,"Very good happy hour food offerings, service was quite good and very friendly. We lucked out with the weather and getting one of the outdoor tables for a boost of Vit. D

The pumpkin seeds are tasty tho a tad saltier than any of us really liked.

The burger was *very* tasty, the fries were crispy w/o being burnt.
The bbq pulled pork sandwich was plentiful with a delicious sauce.

We celebrated a birthday and got a lovely chocolate torte and it was a thing of beauty - rich w/o being overly sweet.

I will definitely go back"
2154236,STREET FIGHTER is my favorite roll! Open LATE everyday (passed midnight usually) . All the Sushi is extremely fresh and tastes amazing! Ambiance is cool and modern. Love it!
1662057,"I went yesterday at 4 PM, right when they opened. The service was quick and cheerful, but the bar was set fairly low, since when I arrived, I was one of three customers in the place. By the time I left, there were still fewer than ten. But, take nothing away from it, they did a good job of prompt and courteous.

I had an Oh! No! roll, a Negihama, a Seattle, and an eel roll. All four were quite good. The Oh! No! sticks in my memory the most of the bunch. The fish was fresh, the construction was good, and I enjoyed myself a good deal.

They had Kirin on the menu, but informed me they'd recently switched to Asahi Dry, which was a letdown. But they also had Sapporo, which was fine.

Good food, good service, good option. Drop on in."
2422539,"First, we came here because Christopher's was full.  

Food:  The mussels, as anywhere in Penn Cove area/Coupeville are great.  I recommend the Rockefeller-style, not the Pistou.  The Oyster BLT was average, so definitely keep your focus on the mussels.  

Drinks: We asked if they could make a cocktail with the Tatoosh bourbon, and received what we were told were ""Manhattan style.""  It was average, and a little too sweet.  

Service:  The reception is slow.  It took several minutes before anyone led us to a table, albeit by a nice hostess.  Our server was cold and inattentive.  Even this did not sour our experience. 

So why the 1 star.  The service when we received our check.  $46 for manhattan style drinks.  $46!  yes you read that right, 46 dollars.  We told our server that we were unaware our drinks were that much, considering the rest of the cocktails hover around 10 dollars, in addition to the most expensive menu item being around 15.  Her response, oh sorry.  Well, is there anything you can do?  No.  Can we speak to the manager?  She gets the manager, who comes about 5 minutes later.  He explains that manhattan style are very strong, mostly alcohol, etc.  We explain that a glass full of ice and vermouth/bitters/soda does not justify 46 dollars.  He responds by taking off 8 dollars.  The point of this story is that, no where in washington will anyone justify a cocktail of that price.  We were very unhappy with how they handled the entire mess, and will definitely not be making a trip back to this mediocre establishment.  Next time, we will be sure to wait at Christopher's."
806983,"No gummy bears tonight! Flavors were meh. Girl was not  generous with portion size. Good 2 for 1 coupon, but not worth it otherwise."
1723696,"Limited menu at 4:30 pm (kitchen closed?)  all they had were prepackaged salads which were very small and did not contain the yummy burger crumbles they promised.  The service was poor (server seemed involved in deep discussions with other customers while working). The food was good, but the portion I received seemed very small for 9 dollars.  I won't go back unless they change things drastically."
2195876,"I'm really not sure why there is a line out the door here on weekends.  The breakfasts and desserts (which are all I've had) are about as good as I cook at home, so, about like a Perkin's or hotel brunch.  Overpriced and underportioned, which frankly was offensive.  I paid $2.75 for a chicken sausage to be added to my breakfast, and received *half* of a chicken sausage.  Rather than give me the entire sausage, which cost them $1.75 maximum (assuming it was organic chicken sausage), someone actually went to the trouble of cutting it in half lengthwise.  Whenever people come to my neighborhood and suggest we go there, I veto and take us elsewhere."
1201629,"Went here last night before attempting to see a laser show that was cancelled without anything being posted on the laser dome website...

I ordered spring rolls and my date ordered veggie pho. Her pho was PHOnomenal but I honestly didn't like my spring rolls. I was expecting the deep fried, unhealthy variety but what I got was rice and veggies and shrimp wrapped in lettuce. My date told me that's a different kind of spring roll. How was I supposed to know?

The waitresses were excellent."
1016090,"Yes, definitely the best fish & chips in Tacoma. Excellent batter, great fish, moist but not soggy ... you know ... everything good fish and chips should be. And the price is right, too. 

But wait! It doesn't end there! They also have great clam chowder and tartar sauce ... both homemade.

My patty melt I had there last time was so-so. I should have stuck to the fish and chowder."
1445070,This place is alright at best. We could have probably gotten the same quality of food with a cheaper price at the mall( since we skipped the hibachi show and ate at a private table). I'm guessing the price is for the atmosphere and hibachi show.
798708,"Their sticky toffee pudding dessert is not the best or even good...

But 4 stars because I really like their thin fries... Skinny fries FTW!"
1031645,"The good,
Friendly waitstaff, and great environment.

The Bad
Food order was lost every time it was to be delivered, (we sat in the bar area). This lead to the Onion Rings being cold, and the wings were lukewarm.

In short I this is a new location, but very poorly run. I don't fault the waitstaff or the franchise, it's pretty obvious that the management didn't train the staff to handle a standard Saturday night crowd."
1680624,"This place is great.  This isn't a sports bar with good food , it's a great restaurant with a sports theme. We started with a bucket of Amber Ale Steamer clams...  So good!!!  For entrees I had the Ciopino and my wife had the crab cakes. Both were fantastic. The server, Rachel was professional, friendly, and hussled throughout the meal service. We can't wait to return for another memorable meal."
1677167,"Very clean food and great service. The restaurant has simple decoration but once you get your food your focus will be only on food. My kids love eating here. 
Con: their large noodle order seems to be smaller than other places."
951731,Always great service and good recommendation by the bartenders.
869385,"The service could be a little better. I ponied up to the bar and another patron did too. It took at least ten minutes for a server to bring us water. And another server was waiting on others at the bar but avoided us. Finally another server came up and took care of us. Definitely go to Happy Hour your wallet will thank you. The El Diablo adult beverage was delicious. The skin on skin roll was tasty and could of been packed a little tighter. That's my complaint with the Super Bad Boy roll too.
It was good but fell apart in the chopsticks. 
No complaint with the Seattle Crunch roll."
784217,"My wife and I went to La Isla last night for the first time.  We had heard that it was a good place.  We were walking Market Street about 10:30 and it looked inviting so we sat at an outside table.  The seating area was mostly full.  After we had been there a while we stopped a server and asked for menus.  A few minutes later someone brought glasses of water and silverware and napkins.  After we had been seated for about 15 minutes we again asked for menus and the lady told us that the outdoor seating was closed and that she could try to find us a table inside.  She gave me the impression that we should have known they weren't serving outside....  Not nice about it at all.  The whole experience rather strange!  We had just come from Ocho across the street where we had wonderful service, a nice glass of wine and tasty small plates.  We were hoping to do the same here before heading home but the service we received was so rude that we went on up the street."
1734738,"Had two artery clogging breakfasts here while visiting friends in Spokane. Wow, just delicious fresh hot food straight off the grill. Staff is friendly and remembered us the second day.

We had the eggs Benedict (excellent) and breakfast burrito (excellent) the first day and pancakes (very good) the second. But the best part was the stuffed hash browns (out of this world). They are to die for (and perhaps from)."" Stuffed with deliciousness"" the server told us and they were so good we had to take some to go for our friends.

Must visit if you're in Spokane , in short walking distance of downtown- just spend 30 minutes on the treadmill first!"
875031,"My favorite Indian buffet...the food is very tasty considering it is a buffet. The lunch and dinner buffet's even include desert! I still have to try something off of the regular menu to give this place five stars. Overall, excellent buffet and good service."
669366,"A year later and my thoughts about the Pine Box are all over the place.

First off -- thanks for taking PBR off your tap list. That was a fucking joke and if you brag about being a beer bar, keep that in a can and save a tap for something interesting.  Your beer list is excellent these days -- just please update when you blow a keg because I hate having to change my beer order 2-3 times each time I visit.

Second -- the ever changing menu. The pizza was and is never anything to write home about. Tasty? Sure. Worth the $10+ price tag? No way. The newer additions -- like the soup and burger are good and more aligned with the price point, but still. The food doesn't live up to the beer list which is too bad. When I drink beer I get the munchies and having something truly worth while to nosh on would be great. 

Third -- the service. It was never a strong point. Granted, you guys do get busy before big shows at the Paramount, draw in the beer snobs in droves, and can get pretty damn crowded. It has been a year though and one would think the Pine Box would have the ups and downs of dinner/concert rushes figured out. Even when it isn't busy you can feel ignored here. The last time I visited the service was absolutely atrocious. Beers took forever to come, orders for food were somehow miraculously put in after being ignored for tables who came in after us, and when it came time to close out our server was too busy clearing tables even though we tried flagging him down for 20 minutes straight. When told we had a show we were trying to make we only got a snarky reply back. I was embarrassed to have suggested coming here for a pre-funk considering how bad and slow the service was.

I can't truly hate on them though. I do love my beer, and they at least have their list figured out with some excellent, quality brews available. They just need to sort out their staff's attitude and service issues before I would ever recommend someone else coming here again."
2163324,Tapas bar in belltown. Excellent happy hour prices
927837,"This place has really gone downhill during the past few months. I used to come all the time and it was really cheap and delicious with great service for the most part! Lately, every time I go I get sick and the food is always discolored.. They also raised their prices."
256302,"First off, this is HOT food.  Both in spice (if you order that way) and in temperature.

The service was SLOW which is my chief complaint.  Took my team there for lunch and we waited way too long for our orders to be taken, etc.  

The food was great.  Tofu soup is what I'd get as you can get meat options in it.  I went for the beef tofu soup and it was LOADED with tofu (so you better like that) and only a little meat :-(.  I ordered it way too spicy and was sweating through my meal...I would tone that down next time to enjoy better.

Good place, would definitely go again."
1909787,"Went here for the first time when one of my friends was visiting from out of town.  Seeing the reviews before, we made sure to get there about 30 minutes early and told them we were fine to wait in the bar however long they needed as long as we could get a good table with a view.  The drinks at the bar were fantastic.  My friend the avid martini drinker asked if they had blue cheese stuffed olives and the bartender said ""no, but i can make some for you real quick"" and he did!  Ten minutes later they sat us at probably the best table for two in the house.  The view was perfection!  We had oysters to start and they were really good though neither of our main dishes were too great - my salmon was extremely salty.  But overall great atmosphere, great time!"
256341,"I found this place to be 'meh' for me.  The portions were a bit too large (I think if you could agree with your companion on a dish you could easily split).

The spices were a bit tangy for my taste.  Chicken was a bit dry for me.

My wife's was good and the pitas were good.  Probably won't be back, but if you are craving and don't want to go far, this may probably work for you."
858697,"Disgusted.  The food was inexpensive and didn't taste too bad, but I went to use the bathroom, and while I was washing my hands, a man wearing a long sleeve white collared shirt walked quickly out of the stall, and straight into the restaurant without washing his hands.   I walked out the door and was horrified to see he was an employee who walked right into the open kitchen.  The man put on rubber gloves and started cutting a tuna.  Unless he has some method to put on rubber gloves without the outside of the rubber gloves being touched by his filthy hands in the process, he took a dump, and then any residue left on his hands touched the fish.  HELLO, just because you wear gloves, it doesn't mean you can avoid washing your hands after using a stall in a bathroom.  I can't go back, and am in disbelief he didn't even fake cleanliness when he saw a customer in the bathroom."
2579731,"Been to other El Toros, this one is new.  All good, Street Tacos are my fav."
1136568,"This place was terrible! We were so glad it wasn't too expensive but we will not be going back. The manager gave us a ""tour"" like we'd never been to a buffet before and it was tacky. I do not recommend this buffet, however I believe everyone should try things out for themselves!"
2152700,"I love Japonessa because it is one of the few, GOOD sushi RESTAURANTS that are open for lunch around this area. Wasabi and Umi are my other two favorites, but almost everything in Belltown is closed during the day :( Anyways, Japonessa has a terrific happy hour which is practically all day 11:30-6:30 on weekdays, 12-6:30pm weekends and 11:30-8pm EVERY DAY in the BAR! Seriously; could it get any better? I have been cooking a lot more to save money but it is really hard to resist Japonessa for lunch! How could I? The prices are great and the sushi is great!

I am NOT a fan of eel but the super bad boy roll is DELICIOUS! You cannot even taste the eel (thank goodness). I usually get the spicy spider roll (probably my favorite). I've had the california (my brother didn't like it; first time he had sushi!), seattle, shrimp tempura rolls; they are all under $7! I may have tried a few other ones, but I can't remember. I always get the miso soup too and it is very good and only ONE DOLLAR!! They do like their mayo sauce on the rolls though...which could be off putting for some, but I don't mind too much. The rolls are also a very good size for the price! (Not like Ohana, where you pay $12 for tiny baby rolls.) I usually will order one and split another with a friend.

If you need a cheap lunch but don't want to skimp out on quality sushi downtown, go here. They are very quick with their service; you can easily be out in 30 minutes! The service has never been anything spectacular but they're nice enough. The decor is beautiful! I took my friend here (she had never been) and she actually painted her walls with the stripes also! It can get very busy in here, but there's usually a spot in the bar and the wait isn't too long. Don't get intimidated when they ask you if you have reservations! I've never had to wait when I go in at lunch time, even on Fridays. The bar can get pretty loud but the dining room isn't bad, noise wise. There are a lot of business professionals here because of the location, but that doesn't mean you need to dress fancy. Just no sweats."
825314,"I hardly ever write yelp reviews. If I do it's because the place offers something that is either world class or god awful.  And for the kickin' boot whiskey kitchen, I am writing to warn you that this is not a real BBQ joint, THERE IS NOT A REAL RESTAURANT SYLE KITCHEN HERE - don't expect good BBQ and other options. 

Rather they receive all their food/meats pre-cooked, and they heat them up on site. That is why there is no smell of BBQ - there is no BBQ grilling going on here. You can see the highly cost effective mini kitchen on your right when you walk in. Unfortunately like most I didn't pay attention to this when I went in, instead looking straight ahead at the very nice looking bar area and the attractive female staff. 

I ordered baby back ribs, one of my favorite dishes based on the waitresses recommendation that they do a great job on these and that the  meat is falling off the bone. Yeah right. The meat was not moist, not slow BBQ, at least anytime in the 12 hours before I ate it. It was surely delivered in a refridgeration  truck that morning or the day before, sitting in a fridge at the whiskey kitchen, and just heated up when I ordered it. the rest of the sides with my order were similarly blah and I have a hard time believing any of them were cooked on site. Same for my wife's meal.

This place does have a nice looking bar, and a long but not eclectic enough selection of whiskeys. But being scammed by the not cheap, crappy BBQ food really upsets me, especially when the waitress was either a willing participant or too dumb to know what real BBQ is."
177110,"This is a story about customer service done right.

My aunt and uncle and I all went to brunch here this past weekend, at her suggestion. She warned us that the place ""can be a madhouse"" and on a Saturday afternoon, it absolutely was. No matter. We put our names on the list, poked our heads into Totokaelo next door, and came back well before our names were called. Standing around was kind of awkward -- there wasn't really any comfortable place to stand and wait, and I felt like we were crowding the poor host. He was doing a pretty excellent job of crowd management, and all with a smile and a cheery attitude -- I was annoyed that he kept letting people who had left the restaurant and missed an open table back on the list ahead of us, but they were all parties of two, so that was slightly more forgivable.

We were finally seated, we ordered and we chatted and waited. Just as I started to silently wonder where our food was, our server came over and informed us that the kitchen had lost our ticket and would we please confirm what we had ordered? She got everything correct, so no need to worry there, but even with our ticket safely in the kitchen it still took a really long time to get our food. Our server delivered the check shortly after our food and informed us that the restaurant had taken care of everything.

Now, don't get me wrong, waiting for the food was a mild inconvenience, but this was really a nice, over-the-top gesture. (And right at that moment, I was really regretting not ordering a mimosa.) My eggs benedict, while tasty, was nothing special, but my aunt's vegetable frittata was absolutely incredible and had the consistency and taste of really well-made Thanksgiving stuffing. Seriously, it was total comfort food -- good thing it came with a salad. The club sandwiches ordered by the ladies at the neighboring table also looked really tasty.

This could have been a disastrous meal, but the positive staff and the excellent customer service saved it immensely. At the very least, they have earned a return visit from me, and I look forward to trying it again!"
1103009,"Excellent night and service. Small place, but very unique!"
1122172,"So delicious, so messy, so good. Worth the wait! Get some! Cash only yo."
1021974,"My wife and I used to LOVE this place, going a couple times a month. However, we won't go back after getting sick twice after eating there. Don't know what happened, but the quality went down hill a few months ago."
843838,"Good food, fun atmosphere... Pretty good service.;)"
571887,"We sat at the bar and had an appetizer. The drinks were pricey and watery (not a great combination), and the crab spread had more tomatoes in it than crab meat. I'd like to go back for dinner sometime just to see if the chowder is really as legit as everyone says, but it's not going to be high-up on my to-do list."
875764,"I don't remember how I heard about Shiro's, but it was a cold and rainy night in Seattle when my sister and I decided to check this place out. We wanted to eat at the sushi counter, but it was packed, so we had to settle for a table. 

Most of the people around us were obviously on dates, so I'm guessing this is the place to go on your first date? Some guy wearing a Boston Red Sox baseball cap hung around our table for a bit trying to make small talk. One of the wait staff approached us to ask if the guy was bothering us. Talk about great service!

Needless to say, the service was great. Our server knew her stuff and soon the three of us were talking about Tsukiji Fish Market and Ginza. And as for the food... The food was fresh! The food was delicious! (Order sashimi; you won't be disappointed!) This isn't some trendy restaurant serving trendy food. I would absolutely recommend Shiro's to anyone looking for an authentic sushi restaurant in Seattle."
777755,"Came here for an after dinner beer last night.  Had to order at the bar so I can't comment too much on the service, but loved the vibe of sitting outside at the picnic tables on a beautiful summer(ish) evening.  Beer selection is good, not over the top."
1010728,"In the everlasting battle for the heart that is my stomach, Potbelly is a relatively newcomer to the foray for me.  I'd heard much about it, seen videos of people performing in their shops, but the elusive sandwich managed to not make it's way into my stomach for the longest time.  That changed this past week.  

While the speed isn't the anywhere close to some other sandwich places, it is the quality of the ingredients, the fact that the sandwiches are toasted, and that they offer more than just sandwiches that has me sold.  And some locations even serve breakfast?  Sold.  I like the vibe of the place.  I like that they put cookies on their straws.  I like that they have local artists perform from time to time.  I know it's just that it's been run through an oven, but it feels like the sandwiches here are made more lovingly.  The staff are super friendly, too.  

All around, a great experience, especially if you're not in a hurry."
1943646,"Our first time here and it was great!
We ordered pork bun, 5 spiced beef wrap, a shrimp dish and Sakura shrimp fried rice. Everything was really good.
I'm not normally a pork eater but the pork buns were delicious."
2573916,Meh. The food was just ordinary. Missing that X factor to make me say wow! A bit on the pricy side for the lower quality sushi.
1783859,"Nice looking place with a friendly staff so I have to give more than one star but the food which I consider unpleasant on a level I have not had before. For breakfast I purchased a coconut water/pineapple/cucumber juice and a southwestern ""egg"" wrap. Neither of which tasted as I was expecting, the cucumber was overwhelmingly bitter and coconut water bland. They actually messed up the wrap and gave it to me as a bowl instead, I took a bite, didn't like it so I asked for my tortilla hoping that would solve my conundrum. It didn't of course and all I can say is that the spice was lacking, the egg was most definitely not egg likely some tofu concoction and at best the closest thing I could relate the taste to is wet skin. My colleague purchased some beet/ fruit juice drink... I felt bad for him as that was by far the most appalling flavor which tasted like dirt. I feel bad giving a review like this especially given how friendly the staff was but really, that meal was too bad to be positive about."
1950863,"Ok, we've been to Beecher's New York and it was phenomenal.  Their mac 'n cheese is addictive.  Beecher's Seattle is different because the one in NYC is rather upscale & the Seattle one is more relaxed; both suitable to their surroundings.  We found the quality very high and consistent between both locations.  If there's a Beecher's around, you'll find us there.  They do need to come to Boise.  Just sayin'."
1227268,"Best fish and chips north of Seattle.  Great hamburgers with lots of cheese and THICK slices of bacon.  Fries are delicious.  This is all I can say for their food, as this is all I order.  Why order anything else when finding good fish and chips in this area is impossible?  Don't know of a sit down restaurant in the area that has a better either.

The service has always been fine when I'm here.  I've been to the bar once on a busy night and had a great experience also.  Kudos Shawn O'Donnell's."
693472,The cherry pie with ice cream and coffee is good.  I was a fan of Twin Peaks so I had to stop here.  I didn't try the food but it looked pretty dinner typical.  It's cool to see all the pictures on the wall from articles that came out while they were filming twin peaks.
1260066,Oh. Look who has ranch now...
984776,What can you say about Carmine's Italian restaurant.. My Family And I Are From Spokane And We Came To Kennewick For Convention and we are sure glad we did because we found this little place called Carmines where the waitress was beautiful.. the waiter excellent.. the sauce the marinara the gravy however you want to call it was cooked to perfection.. everything is hot fresh you can tell that there's a lot of love put into this Italian food..Camine himself was full if stories talked about family.. and for my Italian family it was so nice to hear.. and talk about where our families come from Italy.. don't miss coming to the small little restaurant full of pictures full of family and happy people talking laughing and having a great time
1785750,"I came here for the first time for their New Year's Eve party and had a GREAT time.

(Note: I did not eat food here.)

Showing up: Two of us had bought tickets in advance for the 9pm-close NYE 2014 dance party and two of us... did not. Rather than immediately telling us to get lost, the head of the event came out and looked at the list and told us we could come in since several people hadn't shown up; what incredible consideration!

Atmosphere & drinks: The backdoor is modeled in a speakeasy style, which I LOVE. They aren't tiny, but they have a really cool, almost art-deco bar and low lights. They really went with the theme, and had St. Germain sponsoring the party with great cocktails.

The cocktails really blew me away with creativity and variety. They had one that had acquavit (hat tip to Scandinavian Ballard) and multiple champagne cocktails, plus tons of stand-bys. The drinks weren't cheap, but they were great - and strong - so I felt they were pretty worth it.

Service: The staff was really efficient and didn't let a huge line build up behind the bar for drinks, which was fantastic. Staff were nice, friendly, and suuuuper fun!

And they were on the ball pouring champagne for the midnight toast.

Random: They also have space for a dance floor, and had a great variety of toons, plus free coat check (not monitored). 

 I also noticed they had plenty of parking on the side of the building, a rarity in that neighborhood.

I'd also like to note that in advance of the event I exchanged emails with one of the organizers from Roxy's and they were really responsive. I'd consider holding an event there, and am excited to go there more in the future since it looks like they really know what they're doing."
1967069,"The Beef Bourguigon is to die for.  Super tender and cooked to perfection.  Mac & Cheese along with Brussel Sprouts were the sides.  The Brussel Sprouts was the star side.  Carmelized with bacon bits.

Everything was delish!

Easy to get in and great service."
823831,"French preparation meets local ingredients.  Every meal I've had here has been wonderful. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful and the food is amazing. Great wine selection, wonderful desserts, and the entrees are amazing.  As is the charcuterie.  The chef provides delightfully solid menu items while also demonstrating an adventurous streak -- the roasted rabbit is a delight when it shows up on the menu.  There is fantastic attention to detail in the presentation and service, which combines with the high quality food to make a very memorable dining experience."
1955104,"Perfect food! I have been working in pioneer square the past 6 months and have eaten at most restaurants around here and Tat's and Salumi's are the best you could get in Seattle, hell its the bet ive had anywhere! Get the Hot turkey or the Tat'strami and I guarantee you wont be hungry. I've already gotten 2 free sandwhiches from eating here so much and I will def be coming back weekly for a taste of heaven! Oh and they arent a grease bomb nor messy, good job guys!"
867884,"I really like the decor and setting of this place but I was disappointed with the pizza.  The place is trying too hard to be another gourmet pizza place and yet they fall short.  The menu at lunch is limited and ran the range of what seemed to be typical restaurant provisioner provided appetizers to pizzas that just didn't sound all that appealing.  Having spent time in Italy, I'd love to see a place that calls themselves a ""pizzeria"" just once concentrate on just making excellent pizza and not try so hard to be trendy.  I love the setting and I'll probably go back for that, but as for the food, on first try I wasn't all that thrilled."
893342,"We were so disappointed!  We have tried to eat here many times. There was always a very long wait.  So we were expecting a fantastic meal.  

The bread they served was hard and stale. The garlic oil they serve was ok, but my husband didn't like it at all.  Pretty much just oil with a large scoop of garlic in it. 

Husband got the lasagna. The cheese on top was burnt. He said it was ok, but definite not worth waiting the extra time for. He also got the pasta fugoili. For an expensive bowl of soup it wasn't that great. 

I got some penne pasta thing with artichokes and pesto. I make pesto at home and always have at least 1 fresh basil plant in my kitchen. So I know how fresh pesto tastes. This was not fresh pesto. We joked that we would be able to find a Kirkland brand pesto jar in their trash. There were only a few artichokes pieces in the dish.  The pine nuts in it were good. 

The decor is gross. The curtains in the door frame hang down so low that you have to duck to walk through and I'm pretty sure there was forehead grease on the them.  The wine bottles are dusty. The chairs are horribly uncomfortable, and if you are tall you will feel like you are sitting at an elementary school desk. 

The service was terrible too. We won't be back. I think we may have been very spoiled with So Cals Italian options. In WA maybe we will stick with the generic Olive Garden =/"
867563,"I came here with a friend during Bumbershoot to grab some food before a show. I'd heard good things about Skillet but hadn't been to the truck or the diner before, so I was excited to try it. I am happy to say it did not disappoint! Our food was fast and fresh! And by fast I mean our food was ready within 1-2 minutes of ordering. With the crazy Bumbershoot crowds, that was pretty impressive!

I got ""the basic"" which was a classic burger. It was the perfect size, was REALLY yummy, and the bun actually held up and didn't get soggy or mushy. The burger came with a huge portion of fries, which were also really good. 

I can't remember what my friend got, but I do remember her beer came in a mason jar, which was super cute. 

Overall, the food was great and the service was very friendly! I'm looking forward to trying some of their other locations too."
1002695,"This place is excellent.  The food is always delicious.  I'd never had Lebanese food before and I tend to be a picky eater who doesn't like anything ""weird"" but oh my God was this stuff good. The first time we went we chose several small dishes off the menu more or less at random and they were all excellent.  Just went back tonight for their Sunday special which is a three course chef's choice meal.  These dishes were also all delightful and things I never would have thought to order.  Also the atmosphere is great.  The place is cute, the waitstaff are friendly and very helpful if you don't know how to order or the proper way to eat it, and the music is a fantastic mix of traditional, Lebanese-sounding stuff and The Doors or random 80s songs."
1676072,"I've been going here for years! Both new and old owners. I think one of the main changes that does kinda suck is the price changes, they were slightly cheaper before and the sodas use to come with the lunch special, now you have to pay extra for a soda. 
I always call in my orders, rarely do I ever dine in since I live close to the location. My order has to probably be one of the most complicated orders for them and I've never had them ruin it or get it wrong!!! My order consists of: 
Chicken teriyaki, sauce on the side, with brown rice and salad dressing on the side. Most restaurants I ask for one change to my dish and they get it wrong. But they've never messed up!

This is especially one of my favorite teriyaki joints just because they offer brown rice!!! 

Only thing that they've always gotten wrong is my name...my name is Alexis and they always seem to say ""Alex"" that's the one nickname I definitely can't stand, but oh well. I don't think they'll ever get it right. Lol

Delicious food, clean, and fast. I've never been disappointed!"
913531,"Holy French fries!! These guys are not foolin' around with their fry portions, and they are good! Reminds me of In N Out, but better. I found out you can even order online and walk right in to pick it up instead of waiting. Definitely better than any other fast food burger in Puyallup. Just wish they would have picked a spot with better access, their parking lot is a pain."
878872,"A server in Witness Protection, a 50+ minute wait for French fries (which never came), a 30-minute wait for a freezer-burned corn dog...

No thanks. This place is awful in every way."
1738040,"I realize they are new and trying to get a handle on things, but this place is ridiculous.  30 minute wait for a table - ok, fine.  30 minute wait after you are seated to take your order - completely unacceptable.  Another 30 minutes until our food arrived!  90 minutes after we walk through the door finally have something to eat.  This place is LOUD, I mean extremely loud.  Do not expect to be able to visit with anyone while you wait, wait, wait, and eventually eat.  Food was fair at best.  Sauces were good, but wings were so swimming in it, couldn't tell that it was chicken or something else beneath all that sauce.  Fries were lousy.  Appetizer sampler was simply underwhelming. I will give them kudos for being open til 2am, but with the poor food, awful service, and completely undesirable atmosphere I will not be back."
686167,"I had lunch at Dahlia Lounge, and I thought it was ok from what I was able to sample from their menu. The server told me that the crab cake was one of the more popular dishes, so I went ahead and ordered that without realizing that it was only ONE crab cake for a whopping $19. Yikes! It definitely tasted good, but I don't think I'd pay that money for one crab cake again. 

I actually came specifically for the yummy doughnuts, which are available in Dahlia Bakery next door and across the street at Lola as well. They were warm, fluffy, sugary, but not too sweet. It was really enjoyable especially with the mascarpone cream. I think next time I'll get just skip the Dahlia Lounge and head straight to the bakery for these doughnuts."
222442,"I come here often for brunch and on nice days I like to sit outside. We always get the same thing but it's enough to keeps us coming back. The dungeness crab eggs benedict is so freaking good. Big chunks of crab smothered in traditional hollandaise sauce, it is not for those watching their figure. It is excessive, creamy, buttery goodness and with a side of bacon hits the spot everytime. I can't speak for their other dishes but other people seem to enjoy them. The service is decent as well."
870799,"Can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review about a restaurant I love so much. I work nearby and have been spoiled by my visits here for lunch. I have frequented this business since it was originally Jalisco's and could not be more proud of what they've done and how far they've come.

To start off with, the service and ambiance are top notch. The greeter and server remember who I am and, at times, will remember what I regularly order. Every time I have visited, I have noticed that they have, in some way, improved on the look and feel of their place of business - new decorations have been hung, murals have been painted, and even the layout has changed. They take great pride in what they do and how they appear here. 

My regular dish is a simple plate of chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. What I enjoy is the sauce and seasoning they use. My chicken never tastes like ""just chicken."" Every bite is so flavorful and I don't know how they infuse so much of the dish with the sauce, but it, along with the folks there will keep me coming back. 

Gracias!"
673643,They desperately need to get better wasabi (by far the worst wasabi I've ever had - it looks like play-doh and tastes pretty terrible) and better green tea!!!
1175319,"The chowder is really unique. No (or little dairy) but still kinda thick. Peppery taste.

This is a very friendly, very informal place. Enjoy!"
984614,We went to Cloves to celebrate my friends birthday quietly which we did.  My friend is from Bali so I couldn't tell you for sure what she ordered.  The food was very good and the service prompt.  This place was distinctly  a Queen Anne neighborhood restaurant.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.
1750803,"The fried fish was delicious!!! The outside was crispy while the inside was so moist and flaky. The coleslaw that came with my meal was a little less than par. I am a Southern girl to the bone, so the coleslaw was very dry to me. This was the first time I have tried oysters and actually liked them. I have had them in the past, but Taprock really out-did themselves! I will definitely be returning even though the service was a little less than desirable. 

ps: My husband order breakfast and had the best bacon I have had in a while!"
1349023,"I had breakfast with a group here not long ago. I ordered eggs benedict which was fine, but the hollandaise left something to be desired. Even though the menu says it's handmade, it didn't wow me like I would expect. 

Otherwise, decent service, clean and tidy. I'd say it's as expected and a good, not great place for breakfast.                     Show owner comment »"
1643970,Simply delicious!!! And a fun atmosphere. Loved it!
1286372,"Loved this place! I ended up here with a couple friends. Great space, fun bartender, and most importantly, good drinks. I love Star Brass Works, and love that it's in Georgetown."
169111,"Simple, smart seasonal plates in a small historical West Seattle spot. A sweet little back patio that is cool and quiet on a Sunday night. 

Kale chips, pork tacos and horseradish pulled pork are signature staples. Their summer tuna salad sandwich is fresh and light. 

Swing by now for fall menu items...Curried Butternut Squash, Spicy Chicken Corn Chowder, Oyster Poboy, Chipotle Sweet Potato Shepards Pie and Carmel Apple Remix for dessert. 

Their side dishes and sauces are always a memorable addition to any plate...fresh apple cider dressing on a salad, lime-cilantro slaw, wasabi aioli, apple slaw and rhubarb-pear-apple sauce. 

Fresh flavors throughout the menu with many recommendations from bartenders and owners. Long local wine list and an array of brews which includes a rotating selection of Leinie's from home sweet home Wisconsin. 

Locol is a sweet spot. Go during the quiet hours to bite, sip and unwind."
838193,This was my 2nd time here. The food is so good. Everything about it was great. I had a mushroom spinach omelet. Great staff and just love the lil church. I will be back.
1203724,"I hate to write a negative review for anyone, that being said I live in Texas and this is not Texas BBQ.  I had three meat dinner, Brisket, Turkey and a Hot Link with Baked beans and Mac&Cheese. They do serve large portions, all three meats were dry and had no flavor. The sauce was just a lot of spices again no real flavor. 

I can't stand BBQ when it dry, good BBQ is moist and taste great without any sauce. I just had a meal at the original Salt Lick BBQ outside of Austin all I say is amazing everything they served was amazing. 

Cedar River is located in a cool part of downtown, has a cool vibe inside and the staff was really nice. But I won't be back and will not rave about my  first meal in the Seattle area."
792959,"Boyfriend and I went here for a nice date night. Since we are college students, this was a splurge. We are both avid yelpers, and felt a little disappointed that this sight let us down. We ordered the seared ahi, spicy meatballs, cannelloni, and sirloin to share, and split a bottle of their cab merlot. 

Ahi: The main reason this rating is so low. Over cooked and left out after it had finished so that it was TOUGH by the time it reached out table. It was served on a plate of lentils and kale, which were farrr better than the actual ahi itself.

Spicy meatballs: These were the boyfriend's, so I only had a few small bites to taste. I love spice, trust me, I am not a wuss when it comes to this stuff, but I thought these things were too spicy. They were overseasoned with red pepper flakes to the point that it was hard to taste anything I ate after that. 

Cannelloni: Just plain bad. It was awkwardly spicy and full of a very bland cheese that had no flavor. Didn't even finish this one between two people. 

Sirloin: Well cooked and tender. This was the only dish I liked, but my boyfriend though the sauce was bland disliked it.

Cab-merlot: Served warmer than room temperature, which ruined the flavor.

The ambience was nice, the waitress was friendly, but because of the bad food quality I would not come back."
1893131,"Nearly everything here is absolutely delicious.  The french onion soup is hot and tasty, the Croque monsieur has the perfect amount of bÃ©chamel, and baked macaroni is nice and cheesy.  Whole restaurant gives off a nice vibe too.  The front room is louder and more lively, the back room might be better for large parties or people who want to talk casually over dinner. Bread that comes with dinner is absolutely delicious.

Comment: I think the size of the food here is absolutely fine, but some people have complained that they do not get enough.  Might be good to think about before bringing ""hearty eaters"" to the restaurant."
804817,"Probably the highest quality Mexican food taco truck in Seattle. I've only ever ordered the chicken tacos because I've seen those burritos and I know I can't tackle that much food. The tacos come with two fresh warm corn tortillas, nice chunks of white chicken breast, and yummy fresh pico de gallo. Perfection!"
1512942,"If your mother worked in a kitchen this is the place for you--""eat some more--it'll put meat on your bones"" Breakfast/lunch and early bird dinner specials--Stuffed cabbage rolls simmered in sweet and sour sauce @ $15.50/Old fashioned Baked Meat loaf @ $12.99/roasted brisket of Beef @ $16.99 plus more all served with roasted vegetable medley and choice of potato or rice--fish and chicken served too--or try the lunch sandwiches on double baked crisp rye bread with choice of potato salad, coleslaw or vegetarian baked beans --Hot Corned Beef New York style @ $12.45 full and $8.75 half/Hot Pastrami @ $8.75 full 8.75 half--etc etc--""Where the Meat Meets the Bread"""
121168,"So I am upgrading my rating on this place, because I discovered breakfast here.  I am not a big fan of their Mexican food, though I will stop by for cheap tacos.  Every time I stray for taco's I am disappointed.  However, I recently discovered breakfast, which I am a big fan of.  They have braised rib hash that is very good. It is also a plus that you  can get a good macchiato from Satellite while you wait for your food to come."
1438063,"Awesome pizza and equally talented wait staff. Drew was our waiter and steered us towards the 'Jester' pizza... An excellent choice. Nice selection of beers and ciders. 

Promptly greeted at the door, great job at setting expectations for turn times. Large menu with GF options. 

P.S. Drew has seriously awesome customer service skills!"
1903208,"Twice so far, once dine in, other to go. Excellent all the way around, minus the whole loudness of the building."
1963962,"Seattle Classic! If you can spare the calories and cholesterol, do it! This place is amazing! Don't expect a boushy burger. This is classic & simple drive-in type food. The burgers and fries are so good. The shakes are nothing to write home about, but the burgers and fries, they are epic."
1169127,"Great food, quick service and reasonably priced. Small cafe right on main road, parking is limited but in walking distance from Ferry. It gets busy quick so go early!"
1922137,"Authentic Japanese at its finest!!!  We sat at the sushi bar, made for great company with the chefs and surrounding diners... very lively.  Food was amazing.  We let the chefs choose the sushi rolls and couldn't be more satisfied.  Maguro sashimi was fresh!  Excellent selection of Asian drinks too.  Bottom line... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
1046987,"Went to the Bonefish last night.  The server asked if we wanted a glass of wine or cold beer but never bothered to see if we wanted an appetizer.  We did.  We had the bacon wrapped scallops.  They were excellent.

I wanted the Fontina Chop and they were out.  The server offered to substitute chicken and prepare it the same was as they chop.  Nice effort but I probably should have ordered something completely different.  My husband had the steak and crab cake combo.  Both were excellent.  

All in all the food was pretty good.  I only take exception with the grilled asparagus we chose for our side.  It tasted like lighter fluid."
1016932,"I love pho! 

I just also so happened to spend the week of my honeymoon at a hotel across the street. 

this place is the bomb! great pho, good prices, and a fun little atmosphere. 

the wait staff is a little lax in getting back to you, but we also hit them at the same time the rest of the neighborhood did. so while I wouldn't have minded one refill, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast the food came out. 

I'm talking like two minutes!

thoroughly enjoyed it, and if you need a hint - always go with the rare beef. keeps it yummy and tender!"
1700027,"Cozy and inviting, great selection of beers and ciders that I haven't seen in many other places, and if you are a fan of hot dogs you will not be disappointed.  I thought the Tacoma (it's like a Chicago style) and the Berliner dogs were delicious."
822206,Went here on a lazy afternoon shopping at Mill Creek Town Center and had a wonderful experience. The service in the bar was friendly and attentive and the area on on both sides of the bar was squeaky clean.
823583,"As I walked through the International District, I passed plenty of pho restaurants. I knew I needed to explore the one street of the ID known as Little Saigon, and figured, what better place to have a meal? It was a great decision, too. I went to Pho So 1, touted in the menu as the first pho restaurant in Seattle and ""The Real Taste of Vietnam.""

The service was friendly. I picked a table and was given a pot of tea right away. As I looked around, I liked the vibe that the Vietnamese pop music gave the restaurant, though I was a little confused by the painting on the walls - they looked like scenes in Italy, which was...unexpected. But when I looked down, I was a little appalled as bean sprouts were here and there on the floor. It could have used a sweeping, but also a good mopping.

The menu was varied - they also offered shrimp pho, tofu pho, and vegetable pho, though the menu noted that the latter two were served with beef broth, so they're not actually vegetarian choices. I'd like to try their bun bo Hue sometime, too. The prices here were a little cheaper than downtown. I had a small bowl of pho tai chin, which was $6.50 ($7.50 for a large).

It was pretty empty - I came at 2:30 in the afternoon, a late lunch again. My food came within five minutes. I don't usually have the well-done steak in my pho, but I might have to start because it was really good! The meat was added at the last possible second, just as it should be, and the rare steak beautifully pink. Both meats were tender (the well-done steak a bit chewier, as expected). The meats were clumped together and had to be separated, which some people don't like, but I don't mind since it takes minimal effort. The noodles were perfectly chewy.

I was very hungry after walking around so much, but I really thought the broth was perfect. It was savory, and not oily, so I could consume a lot of it. It wasn't as salty as the broth I tried the night before at Origin Vietnamese Bistro. I was really delighted with the meal. Taste-wise, it was flawless, though it doesn't get perfect marks by my ranking!

I was conflicted over how many stars to award. The pho itself is worth 5 stars, but it's just a shame the the restaurant wasn't as clean as it should have been. With such slow business at that time of day, there was certainly time for a quick sweep. I figure it's cleaner than eating in Vietnam, though, so four stars it is.

All in all, dirty floor included, I enjoyed the experience here and look forward to returning, even knowing that Seattle has other great Vietnamese restaurants worth visiting.

2145069,"SUMMARY: 

Toulouse Petit gets a three out of five stars for the following reasons:

4 star for atmosphere- neat interior, consistent decor, very comfortable feeling. Not pretentious and not too loud. 

3 star for food- smaller portions and while creative, just didn't seem to be either well prepared or well thought out. Braised pork belly was a four star item, but meatloaf sliders and tuna tar tar were just ho hum. 

3 star for pricing- the happy hour rates are reasonable for Seattle but considering the portion size and the flavor of the food, I felt like they were a little overpriced. 

3 star for drinks- good drinks, not watered down, but again, nothing stunning. A good mojito and a good Bourbon St. Lush, but nothing that would be considered memorable. 

DETAILS:

My wife and I 'found' Toulouse Petit after walking around Queen Anne for a bit and liked the exterior decor and 'view in' from the windows. We weren't aware of its reputation for happy hour, despite visiting during just that time.

Overall, my wife and I loved the interior of the place. It was comfortably appointed, not too pretentious, and despite taller ceiling was not echo-ey. We sat at some taller tables away from the bar but not in the dining room proper. I am not a big fan of pub stools but they're often a requirement in a bar area. The space felt very 'authentic' and the details carried through into the menus and other smaller details. 

In the end, a restaurant is about food. And Toulouse has been anointed by CNBC (is that still around even?) as the best happy hour in some geographic region or another. 

The happy hour menu is very interesting to look at- plenty of options and good pricing for happy hour fare. My wife and I went with a meat loaf slider, a braised pork belly, and a tuna tar tar. 

The food was good- very 4 star with nothing really standing out. The best was the pork belly which had great flavors but ultimately was a small portion. The meat loaf slider was a bit dry and didn't have a lot of flavor to carry it without some accouterments. The pommes frites (french fries) they came with were good (again a solid 4 star). 

Drinks were fairly portioned and didn't taste watered down. Again, in keeping with the food, I felt like they could have been better or at the very least more unique."
1048776,Went for happy hour. Amazing. The Philly was out of this world. Same with the Kobe burger on a pretzel bun. Mmmmmmmm
993147,"Crappy, uncreative food, over priced. Not stoked. My salad served in booster seat bowl was pretty standard fare they added piles of cheap onion garnish in place of actual ingredients. And it was generally lacking in any distinguishing features. The beer was great, but overpriced. Chicken fingers looked like they were in a Sysco bag in the freezer just minutes before ending up on my girlfiend's plate. Skipping hop jack's in the future."
1446004,"Had the tonkatsu it was a big order and very good. The salad it came with was good also. Ordered the sushi lunch plate to share it was a big order and high quality fresh fish, even the california roll was good. The highlight of the meal was the toro nigiri so buttery melts in your mouth. Service was awsome!"
956249,Went for my cousins birthday and the food was amazing. Prices are pretty hefty but if you want great steak and a nice dining experience this is the place to go. Definitely suggest this place for date nights. You only need one order for 2 people because the steaks are huge and also come with sides and bread. Will definitely be back here again soon.
830033,"Great healthy food with several organic options! Nice Happy Hour times and prices! 
Tonight, Kathy was our server and she was spot on with filling our water glasses, menu suggestions and the offer of extra sauces, second basket of bread and overall friendliness, but not pushy.  I love their organic salad with the addition of grapefruit and orange slices plus pecans! Tonight, I added the side dish or calamari on top of the salad and it was a lot of food! Sitting out on the patio at Kent Station location and enjoying the warm weather! What's not to love! We are lucky to live close enough to Duke's to make it a regular thing! Yea!"
1954760,"Came here for dim sum with my family and the food is not bad, its decent and worth going to. To me though there isn't a lot of variety and I feel that there isn't much to order. But the service is decent, and it's a great place to meet up with family and relatives for afternoon lunch. Would recommend going to in my opinion from time to time."
964229,"I usually do not give a review for a New restaurant until we have been able to visit it several times. New restaurants do not start out perfectly. They usually take a few weeks or months to truely get their feet on the ground and evolve into what they eventually become. 
Trace now deserves a 5 star!
The atmosphere is hip and upscale, very nice.
The sushi is the freshest and best in town. Try the Trace Rolls.
A wine menu that is well balanced with local, domestic and international selections and not over-priced.
The main menu is creative and refreshing. I had the best salad of my life there a couple of weeks ago. A Pear Salad loaded with delicious Bleu Cheese Crumbles.....amazing!
The service has evolved into a very well rounded knowlegable, friendly staff. They are there when you need them but not constantly hovering in your face.
The bar has a great menu of cool, upscale innovative and tastey cocktails. The mixologists, are very capable and friendly. The service is top flight, obviously a well managed unit. 
It's also a great place to people watch.....see and be seen. You never know what celebrity or sports star you might encounter there.....very fun.
This place had a few minor bumps during start up, but have now really hit their stride!
I guess I should not expect less from the W as they are World Class."
1891791,"Came here at 12am for a midnight snack (7/15/2012). We would of rated it 5 stars but, were not completely pleased with the service and chicken. We ordered Pollo Asado, side of rice, and chips and salsa.  We were confused when the meal finally came. It was their version of pollo asado. If your expecting thin sliced, grilled chicken, you'll be disappointed. It's a marinated breast/wing. Although the flavor was good, it was no Pollo Asado. As for their rice, it was perfect, We wished they would of gave us a larger serving (not just 10 bites). Their chips and salsa were amazing and flavorful! They use canola oil, which is a plus in our book. I'd give them a second chance, and order a different entree."
244048,"I've come here for celebrations a couple years in a row now and have not been disappointed. They have a classy, romantically lit bar area off to the right and have no problems making a tasty mixed drink. The service is of the highest quality, with a well-informed, eloquent, and very polite wait staff. 

As for the food, it's hard to go wrong and everything I've had was top notch. A few must-try suggestions include the lasagna, penne al forno, and definitely the caretto d'agnello (lamb). 

Good for: fancy dinner and drinks with friends or a night on the town with your significant other. 					Show owner comment »"
809482,"I really like Taqueria La Raza. The people are nice and the food is excellent.

The only thing I don't like is that they don't honor their coupons. They make up requirements that aren't stated on the Entertainment coupon. I have a coupon that is printed off the website on my account that is good for an ongoing 20% off the bill and they have denied it twice for different reasons each time.

Besides this gripe they have great food and its a solid choice for Mexican food.

I especially love the guacamole and house made sauces in the squeeze bottles. Mango habanero anyone?"
1897051,"Celebrated my birthday with my boyfriend at Westward. I was so excited to check this place out and we were both so happy with our choice! The food and service were really great. A very classy but totally unpretentious experience.

Eli (bartender/waiter) was awesome -- he discussed bourbon with my boyfriend, and was excited to give us an ""Oysters 101"" lesson that did not make us feel like complete idiots! 

We ate: fried brussel sprouts, scallops with chanterelles, and a pasta dish with dungeness crab, plus a yummy greek donut-like dessert (can't remember the name!). Everything we ate was amazing.

We also loved the ambiance of the place. Perfect for the PNW; clean, classy, not overstated or stuffy. 

Two thumbs up -- we can't wait to go back!"
1328087,"Went to this restaurant for a date with my girlfriend because we were looking to have some good Italian food. If all we had were the main entrees I would've given then a strong 4 stars. However, there were some parts of the meal that really just weren't very good. 

#1 the dinner bread - tasteless and a disappointment. The waitress made a point to tell us that the bread was homemade and that they don't tend to use a lot of salt, so there is season salt on the table. The salt wasn't the problem. The bread resembled a old, bland, soft pretzel. Even with the oil and seasoning it was still terrible. 1 star

#2 the appetizer - bay scallops - this was great, a strong 4 stars. Cooked great and good flavor combinations.

#3 the entrees - crab ravioli with a tomatoe cream sauce & wild boar tenderloin with a gorgonzola sauce. Both plates were good. The ravioli could've used a side of some sort. It came with was some shredded cabbage, we're guessing for color? The boar tasted great and was cooked very well, however this is were they lost me. The potatoes which resembled breakfast home fries were so dry no amount of the gorganzola cream sauce would help. They literally tasted as if the were cooked that morning for breakfast. 3 stars and 3 stars (could've been 4 if not for the terrible sides)

Overall, it was a pleasant time. The main dishes were very tasty. However, for the price they really need to be taste testing their sides and bread service, it really was that bad."
1967602,"WOW, what a great place!  Friendly service, fantastic pastries, special coffee's do take a few minutes longer than regular coffee, but worth the wait.  I would highly recommenced this place to anyone who is looking for a yummy bakery and good fresh coffee's. I'm hooked, Oui Oui!"
2160474,"I wandered into this happy haven searching for fish tacos and, boy did I get what I was looking for!  Now, I know most enthusiasts would say that authentic fish tacos would have the fish grilled, not battered and fried, but I PROMISE you that these are just as good (dare I say better?) than what you'll find anywhere else in town.  The fish is generously portioned and cooked to perfection, the cabbage is a delightful mix of red cabbage and red onion - reminiscent of rotkohl or blaukraut, the crema...oh the crema.  You won't be disappointed.  oh, and bonus?  I came in on Taco Tuesday, where tacos were $2/ea!  

One last thing, the staff are really friendly, and cute to boot ;-)"
1322699,Don't go. Just don't go if u don't want to ruin your day. There's no service at all and they will force u to get dimsums. I've asked them for menu and a dimsum lady got upset and said something shit about us because she had a lot of dimsums to sell but we didn't order dimsum (and I understands Chinese) don't go really.... Don't go.... Seriously don't go... Ahhhhh~~~ don't go.... They say shit about you right in front of you!!!!
1175915,"They are usually good however today I used the drive thru and when I checked to see if my items were all there, the beans and rice and tacos were literally piled on top of each other. I guess I will have to go inside to eat next time so they can properly put my food on a plate for me....."
819972,"I work close to this place so I am always looking for new places to go for lunch.
I came here on a Monday night which wasn't that busy. I hadn't had Indian food in a long time and was feeling a little lost so I asked for some recommendations to which the server said he would give us another minute? After much discussion we figured out want we wanted and our food was delivered soon after. 

I came away from this place feeling like the food was satisfactory but nothing to write home about. The curry was not what I was expecting, I felt that the sauce tasted a little bland and there was hardly any meat. The samosas came out almost too hot to eat and slightly bland as well. It was almost like they were missing something? 

The service also left something to be desired. It wasn't  that our server wasn't attentive enough, he was actually OVERattentive. I think we must have been waited on by the owner or manager, he was an older gentleman wearing a white shirt and dressed differently then the rest of the staff (all in black). There was practically no one there and yet he would walk by our table all the time and blatantly stare at it to check our progress. It felt a little uncomfortable. 

There had obviously been a lot of effort put into decorating the restaurant, but the atmosphere felt very dark and there were flat screen TV's everywhere. I think that next time I go out for Indian food I would like to try somewhere else."
1487928,"YESSSSS. finally a good restaurant in this otherwise depressing (culinary wise) part of downtown!!!!!

What can you say about a restaurant from Chef Rautureau? of course it was tasty and solid. Started with the seasonal oysters, which were fresh and tasty. Then the crab salad (lots of crab, but not mind blowing), French onion soup (fantastic) and the crab beignets (ive never met a beignet i didn't like). Then i had the braised rabbit with papperdelle. SO TASTY. Then ended the night with the pear tartan and MORE BEIGNETS.

Plus the kind of cheesy french decor was so delightful!"
596104,"It is cheap and quick. However, if you need anything from your server, get it the moment they seat you but don't be surprised if they forget ""special requests"" such as low sodium soy sauce or the wasabi/soy sauce dishes. No matter what time of day, they always seem to be understaffed."
282938,"There are quite a few Thai restaurants in Redmond, but none of them have ever blown me away. That was until Bangkok Basil.

Though I've never eaten at the actual location, every time my better half brings home takeout from here, I am in Thai food heaven.

Spring rolls are to die for, the fried rice is amazing. My better half loves the pad thai.

With such great reviews expressing how wonderful the interior and service is, I look forward to experiencing Bangkok Basil as a dine in customer."
1041029,"We stopped in and they were closing early for a private event. They generously still offered us a table although they were closing in just 10 minutes. We opted for To Go so that we weren't ""those people"".

We ordered two lamb mana'eesh and mint tea. Mine was gluten free and my lunch buddy had wheat.  We took a walk and 5 minutes later decided that we should have ordered two more.  And to be clear, we were not still hungry!"
1895064,"Top notch, class, great drinks, and nice staff. Overall this was a great experience. I recently came here for a late brunch and ordered some brunchy food and some real food and all was excellent. 

This is a place that makes you feel comfortable yet classy/fancy. Also, the menu is very approachable which I liked a lot.

come and get ready to try some new combinations."
171706,"The lady at the counter was super friendly and helpful, and she deserves a star! My boyfriend and I ordered baked Swai with green salad and spicy BBQ shrimp quesadilla.

Drinking super cold water, we sat by the windows watching the world go by... Before too long, our food arrived at our table.

I liked their crunchy cole slaw (I would have liked a bit more on my plate because I am a pig). The Swai was baked with lemon mustard sauce, which I thought was delicious with a nice tang from both lemon and mustard. The green salad was, although a bit overdressed to my liking, surprisingly fresh and tasty. There were 6 small triangles of BBQ shrimp quesadilla. I think my boyfriend was expecting New Orleans-stype BBQ shrimp (creole seasoning and lots of butter), so he was a bit disappointed to see shrimp coated in your good ol' BBQ sauce. Well, it was not the best quesadilla in the whole world, but it was definitely not the worst. (Actually, it was quite tasty with some hot sauce with lime.)

I think I still have to go back there for fish 'n chips in order to give a proper review."
832264,"Excellent food.  I love, love, love, that this is an Authentic Mexican place where they use ipads to take (and place) your order.  You even sign the receipt on their iphone.  What a concept--technology meets good old fashioned food!  Great place!!"
255836,"Just what West Seatle ordered:  A deli amongst a long but distinguished list of bars and restaurants!  Where else would I go to get my canned escargot and white cheddar popcorn?  Half of this deli is a store.  The items they sell are unusual and fun to browse.  Lots of foreign items mixed in with the familiar.  Want some Marmite those chips?  They have a couple of cheeses I never saw before (this is in comparison with Central Market, Pike Place Market, PCC and Whole Foods Market), chocolates, sweets, cured meats, soups, sandwiches and ice cream!  

Ice cream:  Dig the selection!  Nutella flavor.  Who knew?  I would have liked to try the dollar mint or find out what the heck is in husky flake, but alas, there was no room after lunch.  Not even for one scoop.  :(  

Sandwiches:  We both got a whole sandwich and split them so we could get a taste of both.  Got the southwest grilled chicken panini and the grilled veggie panini with the wild mushroom field roast both on honey wheat.  Very very tasty!  The grilled chicken is actually sliced deli meat so it may or may not be saltier than the sandwich name suggests but I liked the slight spicy kick to it.  They offer soups, too, but we're still a little too salt conscious to venture into Soups of Unknown Origins (SUO).  

Ordering:  At prime lunch hour the organization of the lines can be a little confusing.  There's a line at the ice cream counter and there's another line for the sandwiches and deli counter.  The tendency is to stand behind the closest person at the right of the register but the line actually forms to the left of the registers.  Of course, the day we went, no one was reading the signs.  One woman claimed she was told there was a separate line for the deli from the sandwiches and started to get a little huffy.  Given that the owner and his son were working the counter it didn't seem likely but the owner took her order separately to keep the peace.  Kudos to him for his patience!   They ladies there soon brought order to the line and the orders were taken quickly and efficiently.  

Oh!  And prices are pretty reasonable, too.  Well done!"
798172,"If I could give it less I would.  Stopped in after working out to pick up some wings. I ordered the Lemon pepper and another (obviously unforgettable). They were horrible!  These fried wings were so dry they could have been chicken jerky and as others have mentioned very salty.
Fried wings? Really?  My homemade wings are so much better and I'll never buy wings here again."
823181,Surprisingly good!  Just wanted a fast lunch.  One order of Teriyaki pork lunch more than satisfied.  Wait staff discouraged us from ordering side of pot stickers.  Good advice.  One lunch ($16) more than enough.  Two mediocre spring rolls.  Three pot stickers slightly better.  Pork teriyaki very good.  Broccoli fabulous!  Stir fried bean sprouts with lots of pepper even better.  Salad and miso soup unremarkable.  But veggies were good enough to tempt us to come back to try more of the menu!
950462,"Great food -- had a delicious breakfast there last week -- but there isn't nearly enough seating. And while pastries and a coffee are fine to go, a full breakfast isn't. I know extra space isn't cheap, but it's no fun to have to wonder if you're going to be able to have a place to sit to eat your breakfast, and to have to rush to claim a table before someone else does so.

Rated high for the food, but this place is just too small during the weekend breakfast hour."
2164869,"My friends and I went on a Monday evening, around 5:30pm, and found the restaurant to be surprisingly busy. Looking at the menu, we realized that it was probably because of the happy hour specials, which goes until 6:30pm. 

Our waitress was very nice and patient while we were waiting for the rest of our party, and when we were deciding which drinks to order. Which, by the way, were super tasty!

The happy hour food was good as well - nothing amazing, but great quality for the price they were at. We ordered the pork sliders, calamari, popcorn chicken, and the bacon-wrapped jalapenos, which were a nice surprise!

I think I would definitely go again for happy hour, to get more mixed drinks!"
859788,"I stopped here for a breakfast sandwich during a weekend visit in Seattle. I was very convinced from both the menu and the cafe appearance. Lots of sunny window tables, fresh ingredients, and they make their bread on site. 

Man, was I seriously underwhelmed. When you pay $12 for a sandwich, you expect it to blow your socks off and do a tap dance for you. It was good, but it unfortunately was nothing I couldn't replicate at home. The sage aoli didn't pack much flavor, and the yolk on my egg was pretty chalky. 

They were also seriously backed up. There was no coffee, no lids, and no sleeves. I told them about the coffee...and waited. I got my sandwich. Still no coffee. Told them again - nothing. Finished my sandwich, 30 minutes after ordering, and still...no coffee.

Seriously? A cafe that waits until they're completely out to even start brewing more? I seriously expected more common sense.

I don't regret coming here, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone until they get their kitchen better sorted out."
1948831,"Had drinks and apps overlooking the water. Perfect place to take guests and visitors. Gorgeous view of the mountains and water. Stiff drinks, good food, and nice service."
903540,"I love the pork belly, it's a mild addiction.  The atmosphere is pleasant in the neighborhood/friendly business area section of Capitol Hill."
1643548,"Horrendous attitude. I hope I am reviewing the right place  between Rite Aid and the northern QFC on Capital Hiil. They treated me like I was homeless and was going to dart out without paying the first time I was there for the lunch buffet. The 2nd or 3rd time I was there they said I had to eat everything and not only one dish (not that I ever ate only one entree.) I walked out and said maybe another time. They also said not to stir the food around because ""someone has to eat after you"". The chicken is cooked with bones so you have to take time eating around the bones it a great way to make you not eat too much chicken. On a plus side many dishes had potatoes in them which I like and the flatbread and place smelled really good but their  horrendous attitude in Seattle's most diverse neighborhood took me aback. I have never been treated this bad in a restaurant in Seattle. Were these guys cooks for a prison or homeless shelter before running this restaurant? They act like it."
1032691,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST GREEK FOOD MY BF AND I EVER ATE!! We ran an errand in west seattle, and drove past it, never heard of it before (been living here for 3 years). Decided to give it a try, because I was in the mood for Greek... and NOW we are willing to drive 30 mins to get it! This place is amazingly delicious, quality food, and Great prices! DO yourself a favor and GO HERE :) Best Greek food in Seattle. Love the taste and quality! Just went back again today ;).

I order: Chicken Souvlaki, Greek Fries, Greek salad, etc."
2164150,Excellent antipasti appetizer. both pasta dishes were light and packed with flavor. The olive tapenade was terrific with bread. Great wine selection.
1524835,"I never had the chance to eat in Seattle Center.. We were here for JT's concert and we were looking for a place to eat in the Armory at Seattle Center.

By looking at the reviews, we decided to give Skillet Counter a try.

We had the ""The Burger"" with Bacon Jam and the Fried Chicken Sammy..

Oh wow.. We were impressed!!! Especially the Fried Chicken Sammy, it's so juicy inside.. one of the best fried chicken I ever had..

My wife still talking about the fried Chicken Sammy the next day.. I would high recommend to try this place out.

Too bad that they do charge $.75 for the water tho..."
1129918,"We're mostly weekend breakfast customers:

Good:
Solid & dependable breakfast menu
Seldom a long wait (this may change when defectors to Portage Bay CafÃ© in Ballard, tired of snotty eggs and long waits, realize the error of their ways and return)
Always a basket of fresh scones with flavored butter. Not GF, tho... sigh.
Fisherman's Scramble rocks
Good service and pleasant staff

Still needs work:
Drip coffee pretty yuk -- geez, this is Seattle, got it? McBurger serves better...
Few to zero gluten-free options
During weekend breakfast peak rush the NOISE can get head-splitting: hang some acoustic dampeners, for goodness' sake!
Tiresomely long wait between bill dropoff and payment pickup: we're done over here!
Stoopid TVs flickering and blaring in the sports bar section, even on Saturday morn.

Been coming here about 15 years, and mostly a good experience. The noise really did get so bad we swore off it at least twice. Then we forget and remember the only the good parts... Oh well."
230162,"Ok, after this i'm going to officially stop reviewing Tom D's restaurants as i figured them all out. 

It's entry level / lazy foodie food. 

His restaurants (and bakery) are upper middle of the road that are placed in places with high traffic. They prey on foodies who want good food while there at work or tourist who dont really feel like scouring yelp. 

I had his turkey sandwich. It's was good but it was also 10 bucks (1 dollar tip). Now while i thought it was good. It does not compare to other 10 dollar sandwiches i've had. But again, this is prolly the best sandwich i've had in this area. 

I think i would give most his restaurants AND this bakery perfect score if everything was like 25% less... Theres just something that wont sit right with you after eating his food. Try and pay for it yourself; you'll see."
894540,"Whenever we want to go to The Hill and not take the bus we prepare for a long walk. We are picky with where we want to park. We don't want to pay to park. We don't want to be in a two hour parking area either if we plan to take our time when we are out and about. So on such excursions we often park in the Central District and walk in. Not too long ago we did just this and came across El Gallito.
I was very hungry and wanted to eat. My appetite is usually much bigger than Steve's.
We sat down and were given salsa and chips. Pretty good, not bad at all.
I got the Green Pork Burrito. The green sauce was the signature Northwest green sauce often with tomatillo and not the hot and spicy green chile you get in the Southwest.
The pork in the burrito though did have some of those green chile spices and flavors which came to me as a bit of surprise. Not bad. The burrito was better than most others since I came out here.
My unexpected surprise as to how well I liked their food will indeed keep bringing me back whenever I am parking and in Central again!"
1930776,"My girlfriend and I had a random craving for sushi a couple nights ago. Normally we head over to sushi land by Alderwood mall but since it was near closing time and due to past experiences, that place usually didn't have too much to offer on their food belt since they are usually preparing for closing time. My girlfriend did some research online and we ended up trying a new sushi spot, and it ended up being Sushi Hana.

We went in around 8 o'clock, so about an hour til closing time. I was expecting the same thing as other places especially the belt had little to no food. I was optimistic none the less and told myself not to be negative and just give it a chance. They had a good menu that you can order food from. The servers were happy to assist us even though it was close to closing time. Whenever we would order a dish the chef and server seemed very happy to help us with it and the server would constantly check on us for refills and to make sure we were okay, which made my experience great.

Overall a great spot to eat at, good staff and great food. Definitely check out this spot if you want some good sushi!"
866278,"I had the plum with with lychee - delicious! 

Entree was Benito with chicken karaage and sashimi. Everything was delicious. The chicken was very tender and seasoned perfectly. Drizzled some lemon on top. Sashimi was albacore a maguro tuna. Yum. 

My daughter ordered the tiger roll, it was huge and she loved it. 

The service is so friendly and attentive. They really love making sure you're happy. We will definitely be back!"
807855,It's your average CJs. Our hostess was beautiful and attentive. Food was okay. 45 minute wait on a Friday evening. :-P
225165,"I am a huge Maneki fan and this place seems a close runner up, so I just had to check it out. The interior is great, the staff is okay, the sushi is decent. That said, I think it is pricey for the quantity/quality of food you get (no offense, but Fuji is not Maneki), the service could be quicker (then again most Japanese restaurants are slow), and the specials do not compare. I am surprised it made Seattle's top 20 sushi restaurants. Seattle has a very high sushi standard and this place is good but has ways to go to be best."
255929,"Unicorn is one fun bar. The decor is unique and kind of creepy (in a good way), drinks are cheap, and they have pinball machines downstairs! Like some reviewers have said, it can get pretty crowded here, but the more the merrier, right? But for reals, try to get here early if you want a seat, unless you're just bar hopping. If they didn't have pinball, it would still be a fun bar, but the pinball machines definitely make this place more fun than your average run-of-the-mill bar. They also have a photo booth! It works, but it just takes a really long time for your photos to come out. Definitely a fun spot."
1102003,"I really enjoy Dahlia Lounge (to be honest I think all of the Tom Douglas restaurants are good). On my recent trip to Seattle I had to go a couple of times and each time I couldn't break away from the tomato soup and grilled cheese. It sounds like the most basic item you can get, but it really is a little piece of heaven. If you really want a treat get their doughnuts, they are fantastic. They were so good we had to get two orders. 

The first time we went Gabriel was our server and he's perhaps the best server I have ever encountered. He was knowledge, kind, efficient and fun. He clearly loves his job and you reap the reward of that. Dahlia whatever you do, keep Gabriel, he's your best asset. 

The service is consistently good and I appreciate the passion the servers have for their jobs, the food, and your experience. I highly suggest checking Dahlia out. 

Also, try their Shrubs (tasty non-alcoholic drinks made with vinegar)"
1833907,"Pretty good atmosphere. Pizza is surprisingly good. Beer selection is OK. Hey, I am really kind of a beer snob. I'm really picky. I am sure the average person would consider the beer above average, if that helps.

This place is definitely worth a try if you haven't tried them before. I will definitely be back."
1492348,"Came here with a huge (more than 20 people) party last night and I was blown away. It is SO difficult to provide excellent food and service to such a big group and Hunger did a spectacular job. Everyone at my table was raving about the dishes; I had the pork belly and the risotto. The proportions were generous. Our waitress kept the drinks coming and water jugs refreshed (with more attentiveness than at other restaurants when it's just two people). I really don't know how they pulled it off!!! Highly recommend Hunger - after 4 visits, I don't have a single bad thing to say!"
2158970,"I could see myself eating here each time I visit Seattle. the simple fact that they call
it pie & not pizza...well done. don't feel you need to get all the weird toppings: duck eggs, lobster, braised greens...keep it simple, the margarita is all that's needed to sell you on this top spot."
1710606,"Part of an app crawl after wine tasting, I would go back

The review is late in being posted sorry"
855558,"For a bakery that would easily have a line out the door and a 2 hour wait on the East Coast, the 15 min we waited for brunch was WELL worth it! Not to mention the fact that the hostess checked in with us a number of times, had us seated in under the time she quoted, and was apologetic for the wait. Don't thank US for waiting a measly 15 min for your fantastic brunch, THANK YOU for existing so we could wait 15 min. My group shared the special croissant with bananas and honey, so good, I want to cry to think I can't eat it for every meal. But that croissant was nothing compared to the fried egg sandwich I got.  Where to start? The potatoes, so deliciously flavorful and perfectly crispy? The homemade potato bread with the perfect amount of crisp with the melted muenster? This thoughtfully crafted sandwich provided the perfect amount of crunch, meltiness (a true scientific term), and spice. The *only* issue I had was that the coffee could have been a bit stronger. But in the grand scheme of things, it didn't dictate my enjoyment of the meal, and plenty of people would have been completely satisfied. Soon enough I suspect Macrina might draw a New York City style crowd, attracting a NYC kind of wait, but based on our experience, it will be worth it no matter how long."
1436631,"So good, and so vegan-friendly! Absolutely love stopping here for a burrito, and now that they have Sofritas (yummy yummy marinated tofu) it's even note satisfying! I could eat Chipotle every day, if only I could afford it! Service is fast and friendly and the store is always clean."
1518250,"Once we homed in on its corner location somewhere in Capitol Hill and found a spot to park, we were surprised to find only one couple dining within this elegantly decorated and surprisingly airy cafe.  They separate the counter and bakery from the area where you sit and order from a menu which is kind of cool since you get more of a sense of privacy.  They have a dim sum brunch every morning until early afternoon, though it's not an extensive list if you're comparing it to something in ID.  My partner picked a coconut raisin bun from the bakery and the General Tso's lunch combo beautifully presented with bright green broccoli, a very tasty egg roll and a mound of white rice.  He really enjoyed himself even considering he was expecting eggs that Sunday AM. :)  I ordered what I thought would be a single serving of won ton soup for only $8, spinach dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  The quiet spoken waiter explained that the dim sum are made to order and would arrive much later then the soup.  No problem, s'okay...  The soup is enormous!  It's served with two spoons and bowls as if the chef is hinting ""so you think you're going to finish this yourself?""  The list of ingredients is brief, but for its garlic strewn, spinach happy, and rich broth goodness it lacks nothing!  Finding won ton soup with quality broth is not a gift to take lightly.  I simply had to finish it!  The won ton are small but full of pork and shrimp flavor.  The steamed spinach dumplings come in three and come in rice wrapped crescents.  The spinach / garlic filling and texture are for spinach lovers only!  Fortunately that describes me to a tee.  My favorite Chinese dim sum is har gow and Regent does them perfectly.  SO much flavor.  A hint of seafood sweetness highlighted against the neutral flavor of glutinous wrapping and that mysterious seasoning I can't quite name (sesame seed oil??).  Glorious!  I had to take 4 dumpling home and I still sloshed all the way home so fat and happy!"
927716,Impossible to get service on a Saturday night.  Waiting for almost 30mins at the bar and the bartender never even glanced down the end where I was.  I just left.  Not memorable at all.  :(
998834,"As a lactose and gluten free eater it's hard to find restaurants that cater to my needs as well as have a menu that won't scare non-vegetarians. 
St. Dames always delivers top notch food, elegant and comfortable atmosphere, and friendly service. 

I love St. Dames, thank you."
2680200,"Ahhhh, I wanted to love this place,not just like it.  Unfortunately, it really did not do much to warm my heart on this cold, rainy, windy day.

First, I must own up to a bit of germphobia.  When I arrived at the glass door of the restaurant, it was so grimy that I could not see inside. That just upped the ick factor for me. 

Once inside, we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff.  We were only one of two couples in the place and needed to keep our coats on because it was just as cold inside.  Also, the TV was blaring some awards show from China while that and the piped in music wafted through the air and competed with our conversation.

We ordered both the egg and chive and pork and chive dumplings and an order of pork fried noodles.  All were okay. In fact, if you come to SDP it should be for the dumplings; little pillowing delights.  My only suggestion would be to have a variety of dipping sauces besides the soy/garlic/ginger sauce we were given...maybe a plum type sauce to balance the savory.

I would have to say this: everything did taste authentic and not an Americanized version of Chinese food. 

One tip: the restaurant is hidden behind the Grease Monkey shop on Hwy 99."
1693030,"My last review was 08/2012, and since that time the original Three Sisters has sold to some unnamed owners who have made a total and complete mockery of this once truly great dining experience.
Have been multiple times since the sale, the last being 12/22/2013, and the quality of food has become disgusting and deplorable!
Under the Three Sisters the interior always smelled of well prepared, fresh Asian Cuisine. NOW, the place reeks of unsanitary conditions. Looking in the side door, the kitchen is disgusting and dirty, and the exterior exhibits the same lack of cleanliness.
Will never, ever go back again, and if you value no hugging the toilet bowl after a meal, you will avoid this disaster also!"
2124867,"Wow I was ever so excited to come here after my friend said that hes coming, so ever so graciously tagged along with him and his neighbour.  So we reserved 2 chickens, and we're glad that they only gave us one.  The chicken is the star of the show I guess.  Honestly its nothing that great. Heavy on the buttermilk, no discerning taste either.  I was more a fan of the sides.  We ordered the poke, sweet bread, manuapua, and musubi and those were all excellent.  The other dissapointment was the saimin.  That thing was..passable at best and would urge people neve rto order it again.  

I've had better fried chicken in Hawaii at SOUL, however we aren't in Hawaii, I'd rather get myself some korean fried chicken hmmmm"
901993,"The food here is consistently good and the service has always been friendly.  That isn't why I am a fan of Joe's, it is because of the huge variety and environment.  It is a fun place to keep going back to visit.  It is almost like a new experience every time I go.  How many places can you say that about and still like consistently?

Gotta go and gotta go more than once."
1716055,"I believe in a thing called love. Portion size is waaaay to much, but it balances out when we start talkin bout drinks.

Zar, ""our"" bartender is the most welcoming guy. 

We left our big NYE plans to go here."
2163025,"Been there for dinner twice.  Friendly, fast and competent servers.  Their cauliflower and onions side dish was piquant and just plain tasty. Both times they had a pescetarian option on special and one or two fish or veggie entrees on the regular menu.  Home style cooking but with a nice kick to some dishes.  

Nice selection of wine and beer. The beer glass is smaller than most though."
839455,"This was unexpected.  We planned on going somewhere nearby, and it was closed.
I had foie and the pork.  
The foie was fine and perfectly matched with the apples.
The pork was perfectly cooked -- medium and not a bit above -- Perfect.  Whoever put spaghetti squash on that is my hero.  I have never seen that on a menu and I love it.  Perfectly executed.

My friend and the clam chowder, which looked pretty cool.

A guy across the way had a chicken and waffles dish that looked epic.

A legit 5 star.  Not 5 stars for the  town.  I'd put it above (the excellent) meal I had a Local 360 in Seattle earlier this week."
1767078,"Great service, great food, menu had lots of options. I would definitely recommend"
188882,"Like others I saw this place when walking to the Sunday Farmer's Market. It popped up super quick and I am surprised I missed it while they were getting all setup since I frequent this part of Ballard. 

Had a slice of the daily special. Pork belly on a pizza?  Yes please! I was lucky to get it fresh out of the oven. I have come back since and found that the extraordinary topping probably saved the day the first time around. On my second trip I had a plain jane slice of mushroom and I felt the same lack luster enjoyment of their reheated crust as my surly friend had on our first visit. I didn't understand what he was talking about until now.

Summary: Run don't walk if the pork belly pizza is their special of the day, otherwise this place is only good for a quick bite if you aren't looking for anything special. 

+: Standing counters for quick in and out dining. Full front opens up for nice weather days. 

-: No ranch for you pizza and ranch fans like myself. Not the best crust on the block or in town."
1321138,AMAZING!!!!  The best around
929066,"Seattle Deli was originally the best banh mi place until Saigon Deli appeared. The deli is fresher, more variety and the meat like the bbq pork for example is more flavorful and moist. So delicious yet for under $3, it's worth the trip!"
805172,"Yum! The All Hail Kale salad and the Carrot Cake are delicious! I also tried the lentil soup, which was delightful. Perhaps my favorite thing though about Veggie Grill is the 'Iced Tea Bar' which offers several kinds of iced tea, which you can mix and match! So delicious. The only reason they get four instead of five stars is that their containers and take out supplies aren't compostable or even recycleable. I would expect that to be a no-brainer, so hopefully they are moving in that direction."
787917,Great experience there the other night...my large pie had 2 slices with burnt crust...didn't even have to mention it..they came right over with 2 slices from another pie..Good PR guys and delicious pizza..keep up the good work!
1642664,"I've ordered from this place twice now, and each time has been mostly fantastic.

the first order was a bbq chicken pizza on gluten free crust, and bbq chicken wings. all of the food was really yummy, and the gluten free crust was flavorful and delicious (though it's $5 extra which I thought was a little pricey).

the second time I ordered, we got the saturday night on regular crust and a caesar salad. again, very fresh tasting and yummy ingredients. 

my only quip is there is a random $1 surcharge that was visible on my reciept when i got my orders. why? they say delivery is free so I don't understand the charge. it's only a buck so it's not a huge deal, but I was never told about it which is sort of odd.

this is pretty much now my go-to pizza place, it really is very tasty."
537710,"The paseo press was delicious. The ham, cheese, carmalized onion, juicy shredded pork combo was married to the toast baguette well. When I was done, I didn't feel disgusting either which for me means that the size was just right. I added jalapenos which felt right and it was.

Looking forward to taking my brother here who appreciates a good sandwich."
669761,"I came here today with a coworker for Seattle Restaurant Week lunch and it was AMAZING! It's tucked away inside the Fairmont Hotel and it's really elegant, the decor is simply beautiful and very classy. The restaurant itself doesn't really feel like a typical restaurant because there's a lot of light and it's pretty spread out and well, you're inside a hotel. Usually, hotel restaurants aren't the best, but The Georgian is pretty top notch.

Their SRW menu was really good and I had a tough time choosing between the halibut and the tofu medallions, but saw the arugula on the halibut so went with that instead. I also got the seafood louie salad which was a huge portion actually even if it didn't look like it. They are also super generous with the fresh shrimp which was very tasty! The food was beautiful and really extraordinary, their halibut tasted divine too.

My coworker also got the soup of the day which was the split pea soup and a Caesar salad. She enjoyed the soup and told me to write about how good it was. :) I also really enjoyed the starter bread, it was unique and a variety of chips, bread and I'm not sure what else it was.

The service was so perfect that it almost made me uncomfortable because I got there for the early lunch around 11:30 and it was super empty. The servers were so polite and very attentive. I also found out that the back dining room can fit up to 14 people which might be a great option for a private dinner too. I'll have to keep that in mind for work parties.

All in all, I would definitely come back to try their afternoon tea or dinner because prices are reasonable for downtown Seattle and the quality of food they prepare. I also loved that they had a unique menu with the different health-conscious options for vegans, diabetics, etc. That was super thoughtful."
1678358,"Located in a strip mall, it might be easy to miss ...but well worth the effort to find this place.
It is a Restaurant; small grocery store; bakery; and tortilla factory, Ramirez' restaurant side makes a HUGE burrito (I have never seen such a big burrito). My husband was starving and could not even make it half was through, I had the tostada/taco plate with beans and rice. It was very good. The green sauce they use on wet burritos is amazing.  While I was there, I bought some fresh chorizo and some al pastor meat in their meat market,  and some fresh masa from the tortilla factory to make some tamales. We have been back a second time for dinner and more masa. The people  working in there are very nice. There is a wide range of people that come in there to eat all ages and walks of life, and everyone seems to enjoy the food. I grew up in Mexico and I am familiar with the sodas from Mexico, this place serves imported sodas , so if that is not for you, then be sure to ask for a local one or you could ask for an Horchata if you want to try something different.  On the second visit I had the green enchiladas with rice and beans and the husband had the Steak Torta. 
Do not hesitate to give this place a try their food comes very close to the food from Mexico."
1672078,"These grinder sandwiches are worth the wait! The staff is always super welcoming too, which can really make or break a go-to eaterie for me. I would recommend these, especially to-go for those slightly dehydrated weekend days on a couch."
2130687,"HOW does this place average 4 stars?

I have very low service expectations for dive bars, however this place was just.... terrible. As soon as you walk in it's really unclear if you wait in line, seat yourself, put your name on a list, etc. (UPDATE: apparently there is a sign indicating to seat yourself. My apologies, we obviously missed it. I stand by the rest of the review however.) Eventually we figured out you seat yourself so we just sat down and eventually someone threw (not an exaggeration) menus at us without saying anything. I ordered an omelet with NO MUSHROOMS (I am allergic and made a point to say so twice). Omelet comes (35 minutes later) and the first thing I get a forkful of? Mushrooms. Waitress sends it back. Got a new one right as my boyfriend finished up his meal. This time they forgot toast. I didn't bother saying anything, and wouldn't you know it, she brought a plate of cold toast after we paid the bill and were getting ready to leave. Oh and I got charged for two omelets on the bill, so that had to be fixed too.

The food was also really, really bland. Omelet and hashbrowns were extremely greasy and did not have a lot of taste. We definitely won't be going back."
1506037,"So we have been waiting for this to open and very happy to see it.  Tallulah's has a great atmosphere and menu.  We tried a few of the small plates, all very good and I tried the hangar steak, which tasted very good, just wanted more of it.  Topped it off with the chocolate pudding cake that was delicious. The beer, wine and drink selections were very good. The service was excellent and made for a great evening."
1380211,I discovered this place a few months ago.  I am particularly fond of the Vietnamese pancake.  They do a great job on their food.   I am hard press to find another Vietnamese restaurant that is as good as this place in North Seattle.
1946649,"We haven't found awesome dim sum in Seattle, but this is definitely getting closer to what we're looking for.  Sunday morning at 9am, and there were still plenty of open tables.  We were the only non-Chinese in the restaurant as well.

We got our favorites:
- shu mai
- sticky rice (this came with full-sized shrimp, which in our experience is untraditional)
- BBQ buns: baked
- BBQ buns: steamed

I enjoyed everything we ordered.  We did try to order the pan-fried daikon cakes, but something was lost in translation.  They never came.

I found it quite good.  He was less of a fan (and would probably rate this 3 stars).   

I wouldn't say it's ""the one"" though, but that's ok for now.

Oh, and total cost before tip:  $11.60."
1960962,"The cramp chowder soup was great...The rest that we ordered were ok.  Reasonable prices.  The lady who served us was very friendly to a point make me a bit uncomfortable - still a good thing.  Didn't have to wait that long to be seated. It looks fancy inside. Restroom was very clean and modern.  2 person about $70-80 for 2 appetizers, 2 entries, and 2 drinks.  Seats were comfortable and has TVs."
919070,"I am no stranger to Claim Jumpers and have to tell you that on this day it was not my restaurant of choice. However, a member of our party was insistent on CJ's so here we go!

Started with an appetizer. It was decent. Not as hearty as tater skins I've had elsewhere and a small portion of toppings and ranch to go with it. In the end, it came off more like a half order. 

They made a mess of our orders, overcharged us and in the end asked if we minded having our leftovers put in a single tray instead of tree separate ones. What the!

Amateur hour around here and for my 1st time at this location I can tell you that a change in management may be in order. 

In general, this place is a fraction of the place it was a decade ago."
898786,"I thought the decor was a bit over the top. The bar was ""all dressed up with nowhere to go."" Translation: fancy but empty. My boyfriend and I went between lunch and dinner and were kindly given the option of either menu, which was nice. I had bought a $20 for $11 deal on Groupon otherwise I would have never dined here because the location is not very appealing (Fridas is in a commercial shopping lot shared with Rite Aid, Albertsons, and McDonalds...blegh!). I ordered the fajitas and they were good but they didn't come with avocado/guacamole, which is a complete and total let down for any avocado-enthusiast like me. My boyfriend ordered a sangria and I had a margarita, both were delicious! Overall, very quick, friendly service; good food but nothing out of the ordinary; very yummy drinks; unfavorable location; unusual and unique decor; fair prices.
I would come here again and try more new things!"
547767,"When I went in here, they had a cool deal where if you like em on Facebook, you get a free appetizer. Win. 

Everything we got was good, but the beer was just so-so. And I even tried two different types (which I can of course not remember, but it was the brown and the summer, and they both fell short). Seating is a little awkward. 

Parking is street, but I never feel like that's a big deal in the area. Worst comes to worst, you're walking a couple blocks.

The waiter was a bit forgetful and the pricing was nothing to write home about. 

I thought the lighting was nice, though. 

I don't think I would go back without first checking out what other Mediterranean food the neighborhood has to offer... but I would go back someday. Probably."
1794083,"I've heard really good things about Patty's Eggnest, however the the customer service isn't as great as I thought it would be. The food was amazing, definitely better than your typical Denny's or IHOP. I was disappointed in the customer service simply because it took forever to get servers attention. The place is clean and the food is yummy, the customer service is just the one thing holding me back from eating there again!"
812793,"Wood fired pizza. Perfect dough. Perfect ingredients. Three cheese, Meat Special and Pepperoni all a tie for the best in Seattle. AMAZING staff. sweet as pie. ha! lol go there. you'll love their food. you'll love their staff."
1771386,"Remember the B&O espresso? There were many things to love about that neighborhood joint back in the day, but at the top of the list were its pastries and desserts. Ãclairs, carrot cake, and croissants that were more heavenly than Jesus ascended, brought to you by a talented pastry chef named Eric Todd.

As luck would have it, Eric's delightful confections have been reincarnated in this wonderful neighborhood cafe, on bountiful display immediately as one enters. As a morsel of this man's carrot cake entered my mouth during a recent visit, a wave of nostalgic pleasure came over me--the same one might feel, say, bedding a former lover. One might argue that sex and carrot cake are not equivalent pleasures, but then I'm betting they haven't tasted Mr Todd's special sauce, or special extract, or special whatever it is that he puts in his treats."
1954005,"I have been to Le Pichet many times over the years and this time, the food was as consistently wonderful as always. However, the bartender was completely charmless.  We sat at the bar for some drinks and a light meal before an event.  Even though we were sitting right in front of him, we couldn't get a drink out of him. He had a very condescending attitude, he was completely inefficient and had no interest in serving us and seemed to go out of his way to avoid eye contact.  He kinda spoiled our experience and if I saw him working there again, I would go elsewhere.  I have never stiffed someone their tip in my life, but came pretty close with him."
1331221,"Laredos is one of my favorite ""go to"" restaurants when I want delicious comfort food.  The service is great and everything I have had on the menu is outstanding.  Although sometimes a bit crowded and loud, it continues to be a great place to dine on an average budget.  The chili con queso is great and even better if you can get it from the happy hour menu at a lesser price.  Also, the Mole Enchilda's are a favorite of mine and the fact that they have a larger than average selection of sauces to choose from makes this neighborhood joint really stand out."
814297,"10.99 All you can eat fresh Fish and Chips.  Have been unleashing the furies of hell upon this place for years, back to the days when it was called Moby Doug's. Come for lunch and bring the pain because they will serve you plenty golden fish with chips along with a smile. GET SOME!"
857602,"Wow what a Christmas Eve dinner to remember. From the starter Champagne, the artistic pear salad, the wonderfully created Atlantic Salmon full of flavor, the ambiance and the warmth of the staff, we loved our evening. Jason and Nicole Wilson have time and time impressed us with their creativity and culinary excellence. Truly a place anyone in Seattle should visit if not for special occasions and any other time of the week especially if you want to experience exceptional cuisine."
180606,"My sister raved about this place. I found it to be overpriced and greasy. The restaurant was nice and the service was friendly, but I don't think I'll be coming back. 

We ordered the limited edition creamy chicken ramen, edamame, and tempura. The tempura wasn't bad, a little greasy, the edamame was to be expected but the ramen itself was fatty and not very flavorful. 

My favorite ramen place in the area is still Yoes."
878636,What a great place. Well worth the wait!
1299878,"Spendy for a ""dive"" bar, but they have creative food and drinks. Fun, unusual atmosphere - great place to take visitors."
1462687,"It's Friday night. It's packed. I got the attention of the staff barely before I was in the door. The staff were SUPER sweet to my nieces. Customer service: A.

I never had gluten free pizza before. That is specifically why we came, as my extended family recently discovered this food intolerance. This is exactly how I want crust...thin, crispy...basically as a tool to funnel cheese and other delicious foods in my mouth. Loved it.

Also, free video game and pinball for a quarter? How can you go wrong?!?!?"
863662,"I first heard of this place when I used to work at a middle school. The attendace lady who lives near here raved about it; it took me almost a yr to give this place a try after some research. I have to admit, Ive only had one dish here, but I still think it's worth writing a review. 

Banana French toast (dk the exact name but it doesnt matter since they only have one kind)
 So ...let's just say that this dish was SO freaking awesome that I used to, for a while, wake up super early, get there w/i 10 min of their openinh, eat really fast and rush to work. 

I think they uae ricotta cheese... It melts in your mouth soooo rich. The hazelnuts add a crunch factor. The banana and syrup obviously thr needed sweetness."
883143,"Believe what has been stated previously about agonizing slow service and painful disorganization. Doubt the accolades about food taste--it's ok but more of a 5 out of 10 rating. And what Asian restaurant runs out of rice and has to serve noodles with Hunan chicken? Don't eat there or order take out from 6-8 unless you are prepared to wait at least 45 minutes. 
All the owners need to do is hire  an assitant prep chef/dishwasher and they could easily meet demand in a timely manner. It's  just not friendly to tell a starving customer ""everybody come at once, very sorry."" That's the restaurant business cycle, isn't it?"
1125991,"FANTASTIC. That is the only word to describe the sandwich I had this afternoon. I wasn't sure what to expect going in here, but the yelp reviews persuaded me. 

A small and cute little sandwich shop right in the heart of Fremont. The service was very kind, and helpful in assisting me.

I ordered the roast beef one (forget the name), and I watched them prepare it cheerfully right before me.

As they were finished, they presented me with their special red sauce on the side (which was amazing as well!). 

I devoured it right away, and literally would consider making the trip from Everett to Fremont simply to taste another one of those perfect warm toasty sandwiches. 

I honestly can't think of anything that would have made my experience any better. This one is a no brainier. 

Go there!"
1126448,"Coming from new york, vegan means vegan. That means no eggs or Meat will be served in the location as well. We called up Darbys and asked them if their menu was vegan and they replied YES. We came by, very excited and saw they were serving corned beef.  What?! The place had loud music and a youthful vibe.. We came in with our kids and the waitress asked us to please wait outdoors while they prepare the table. Mind you, this is Washington state and it was pouring rain outside and very cold. I was SHOCKED that she had the audacity to tell us that. While we waited outside, no one informed us about the status of our table, after waiting TWENTY minutes and not being told anything we left. In all my life, i have never been treated so rudely by a restaurant then Darbys has."
1379067,"Food is awesome. Every time I stop through there is always a line. Nothing bad to say about that, the food is better than the other food located around. Service is average. Limited interaction with staff. The time it takes to get your food is so fast. Stop by this shop and enjoy an experience of good food before or after your shopping adventure. Enjoy all"
1093625,"The best place for pizza in town! Staff is friendly, entres are well priced, and the atmosphere feels like a classic pizzeria. The dining room can be a bit crowded as it is very popular, but take out is always an option!"
2702664,"I like this place quite a lot. The service is pretty good here. Food portion is pretty large and the it actually tastes quite good in my mind! The food is a little bit more..maybe $15 a plate, but if you come during lunch (and not dinner or weekend), the prices should be quite affordable (although probably smaller in portion).

I don't have too high of a standard for Korean food..but for once in a while when I have craving and don't want to go too far to search for a good place, this is probably my go to spot. It's nice and well hidden back in a building. The restaurant is small and quiet enough for you to sit and  enjoy your meal...plus I always appreciate the banchan snacks that they provide regardless of what you order, too."
2121551,"If you are looking for the best breakfast in Seattle, this is the spot.  Fantastic selection of savory or sweet from eggs to omelets to pancakes to waffles.  We stopped by for a late breakfast and ended up going with a burger and fries instead.  Food was good, service was excellent, and loved the vibe.  It was definitely a good hangover cure and you could tell people were looking for a little pick-me-up after the night before.

I'll definitely be back."
268622,"Yes, YEs, YES!!!!! Off the beaten path in a cute little house is La bon Ton Roule- do yourself a favor and GO! First of all - Oysters are only 1$. Everyday, ALL day! Their Oyster shooters were pretty http://bomb.com also- made with pepper vodka and cocktail sauce. 

Now, onto the highlight of my night, the ETOUFFÃE. This consisted of, Crawfish, Shrimp, The Holy Trinity (for those of you who do not know this Cajun recipe secret: bell peppers, onion and celery) Cayenne Pepper, and Rice in a Dark Roux Sauce. It was AMAZING, the bowl over flowed with this delicious mouth watering dish and I ate every last bit of it, two people could possibly share it if they aren't big eaters. My boyfriend ended up getting a Po'Boy and was very pleased himself, but my dish definitely won the throw down. The ambiance is fun, slightly hipster-esque but more of an older crowd, at least when we were there.

 I can't wait to go back - my mouth is already watering!"
2162425,"Great staff and wonderful mixed drinks! It can get busy so be patient and wait for a table if need be, it's worth it! AND if you're on a date, bring them here for cocktails!"
982709,"Went for date night, and it was wonderful. Great food, and service!"
532409,"Best Thai food I've had, hands down, either here or in Thailand. It's all good, but I always get the Pad Thai, which is rich and smoky in a way that no other Pad Thai is. I've heard horror stories of unsanitary conditions, but I'm just not the kind of guy to worry about that. If I actually get sick, then I'll worry."
935613,"That was seriously delicious.  Birthday dinner with my husband and 10 year old.  We all loved it.  My kid wanted to move into the apartments above so she could eat there everyday.  Very down to earth and friendly service, terrific ambiance.  I'd hang out for hours if they let me. Good timing on all courses. Highlights  Moroccan chicken wings --perfectly spiced, Merquez sausage and cous cous, Kebab with stuffed grape leaves and Grilled pork with carmelized apricot.  The breadth and depth of flavor was amazing.  Only tiny misses: pork rinds a little over salted and brÃ»lÃ©e was a bit ordinary but nothing that wouldn't keep me from returning."
805397,"Small local restaurant on a quiet street that is seemingly hidden a short distance from the University Village. I believe it is looking to be a boutique place. The dishes were small and they weren't inexpensive by any means. 
Our group was there from happy hour into dinner. We tried a brisket sliders, sliced potato and sauce, hummus with toast, green salad, free range  1/2 chicken, roasted pork belly, a slice beef(?) dish, and bread pudding.  I'd have to say that I wasn't very impressed by the small plates. They were at most just average to me. The chicken was good and probably the better dish of what was sampled but I wouldn't say it was the best chicken I've had. 
There was plenty of street parking around and it is across the street from a cemetery. Service was friendly but interesting in behavior on clearing the table as quickly as noticed but seemingly didn't feel that there was a lot of checking in on additional things we may have wanted."
1000268,"We have been here several times, & I can definitely say the only thing that is consistent at Buttered Biscuit is their slow service. Food is meh, if you like big portions, lots of butter, grease & sugar. 
The last time we were there, no one was at  the front greet to us & seat us. Someone peaks out from back & finally tells us we can sit anywhere. Anywhere - if you can find a seat. Practically every table had dirty dishes & glasses. The manager & the 2 waitresses were too busy doing coffee & food orders to care how their dining room looked. They were not concerned at all to clean up their dining area. Disgusting. We finally found a spot way in the back corner & waited 7 min. for a menu & to be asked if we'd like coffee or juice. Another 8 min. , our waitress came back with our beverages & took our orders. My husband put a timer to see how long it would take for our food to arrive. 
After a good 38 min., of waiting for our breakfast & that piece of their cornbread that they are known for, our food arrived. We still had to ask for the cornbread because that hadn't come up yet. The food looked good, but looking & tasting are 2 different things. I guess you have to ask for everything nowadays...
My daughter had Berries French Toast, which she thought was too sweet. She took a couple bites & she was turned off. Couldn't even get her to eat it the next day, because she was afraid it would give her an upset stomach. 
My husband was happy with his Don't be a Chicken platter. His gravy was pretty tasty, he said, & the chix fried steak was crispy, even under all that gravy, at least for the first few bites. 
My Brihanna Eggs Benedict was all wrong & disappointing. First of all, I must explain that I always order this dish because the sausage patty is really delicious & moist. And the Poached eggs have always been done just perfect - when you cut into the yolk, it pours out so luxuriously. This time, the entire thing didn't taste the same. the sausage patty was obviously missing & the waitress didn't even mention it when I ordered. Then, one of my poached eggs was overdone & hard, talk about disappointing. We called our waitress back, I didn't want to mention the egg being overdone because who knows how long it would take for them to get me a new poached egg. But, I did mention that my sausage patty was missing & she wasn't even aware that the kitchen didn't have any of the sausage patty to serve that Monday morning. She went back to the kitchen to find out why I didn't get a patty. Their excuse was ""they were busy that weekend & must've run out"". I guess the kitchen & front staff do not communicate. What a way to run a business!!
It's going to be a very long time before anyone can convince me to go back to this place again. Sorry BB, I've lost confidence in you & I surely won't be recommending your place anytime soon. Oh, & BTW, during our whole meal, we had to look at dirty tables.  That was really appetizing...NOT!
HIRE SOME EXTRA PEOPLE, BECAUSE YOU SURE CHARGE ENOUGH TO AFFORD SOME MORE HELP!!!!"
789640,"Totally a 5 star Chinese dining experience ...... Except for the typically loud, crass, obnoxious, local crowd that you would expect in a W.T. neighborhood.  Thanks Everett!  The food was very fusion and very well done.  Noise needs to be dampened... And so does the patrons. Great half price bottle of wine Monday dining. We had a bottle of 09 Stags Leap Petite Syrah which paired excellent with Chinese food. I wish this place was somewhere like Edmonds"
234248,"So after 3 very satisfying visits here, with perfect score for each, I have to say this place is a pearl!!! 
Love love love the food!!!! Great flavors, fresh ingredients very unique combinations and yet very simple. Every bite you take is fireworks in the air, which makes you want to order the whole menu. 
I personally fell for their stuffed eggplant !!! 
One more important thing is don't ever give up desert at this place!!!! They are all amazing!!!
They also have great service, all the waitress we were taking care by were extremely nice and patient and I have to mention Kevin who was the first one to give us the great service and made us come again for another visit - good luck here Kevin!!!"
1687240,"it was way Too loud in here last nite. they had two or three big groups mixed in with the regular customers. theres no sign saying seat yourself or wait to be seated--its just figure it out on your own. Soon as we walked up to look for seats one of the ladies blocked our way and said noo seats but there were plenty of tables in front of us. i dont know if she panicked because me and my friend are heavyset but that didnt make sense to say that when there were seats. the girl who sat us only brought us one menu and didnt say if she would be back or if anyone would be serving us soon or not. after she brought water with no straws and ran off....eventually a man came and he didnt say hello or anything, i had to start the convo. he didnt write our choices down; he just stood there and then my friend ordered and he asked my friend if that was for sure what he wanted??? its like we can read and weve had wayyyyy better vietnamese food than THIS. soon as i got home i had to run to the bathroom. we ordered the spring rolls but there were small and not cut in half nor did they bringg us plates to eat on. we had to ask for silverware and then there were no bubbleteas for the rest of the night. i had to ask another waiter to be sure because ours didnt explain so she said they Ran out of milk for bubble tea. what kind of bubble tea place runs out of milk?? there was no sign to tell ppl this before they walked in. the dishes they served the food on was so worn cheap and old, u could see the faded lettering and designs and the hoison sauce and chili pepper sauce was in ketchup and mustard bottles with no labels..u just had to figure it out. i ordered the 31 but it didnt seem like chicken..it seemed like pork chicken and something else..the noodles were all stuck together and it didnt have much flavor. it was missing the second broth (i know ebcause ive had it other places). it didnt taste like ANYTHING. i wanted more water but they never came back. there were dirty tables w dishes and all the employees kept walking past them. when we were done we were waiting for the check but they never came back. i had to shout to get the girls attention. she kept avoiding eye contact even though she was right there continously..rushing around like a chicken w her head cut off...so then i asked her if we had to pay upfront. we went upfront and we didnt have a ticket so i dont know how they remember all the orders this way but we were up there with the takeout ppl waiting. theyre menu at the front for to go doesnt even have everything that they serve on it..its like u just have to explain to them what u want and somehow theyll make it..horrible food and horrible customer service. if youre gonna call yourself a vietnamese restaurant, do it right"
2151629,"Drove all the way from Snoqualmie Ridge to check out a rare sighting on the eastside- hot pot bibimbap. For some reason, very few Korean restaurants carry this dish 'round these parts. We got there fairly early around 5:30 and got seated quickly. It's a large restaurant with lots of seating but as far as I can tell very few servers. Our order was not taken right away and I noticed that patrons who were seated after us were being served a lot earlier. Maybe the three small kids I had was scaring them off? Anyway, ordering took wayyy longer than expected. Ordered the Hot Pot Bibimbap for myself and husband and for some reason they only wrote down ONE order. Therefore, husband was without an entree for awhile. The side dishes were mediocre and the kimchi tasted like it came out of a prepackaged container. 
The bibimbap was okay. It was pretty sparse compared to the bibimbap I've had at other places. The experience was not good enough to warrant a second trip, especially since it's a 40 minute drive."
1901910,"My boyfriend and I went to try this place out. My boyfriend's roommates had warned us the service was bad. We tried it out anyway. 
My boyfriend likes sashimi and nigiri. I like a mix of that with at least one roll. Once we ordered mostly salmon and tuna nigiri. They offered higher grade salmon and tuna not listed on the menu or maybe we have missed? We got really thick slices of fish on our nigiri. I am not going to complain since it was good. 
Sadly in the greater Seattle area there are more fusion restaurants. I am Korean and love Korean food. I will most likely not get Korean food here. I will go to a Korean restaurant that will focus on Korean cuisine. I agree with a lot of yelpers who want authentic foods. If you want really good sushi, don't get it from a Korean run business and go get it from a Japanese run business who has a Japanese chef.
I am sure my bf and I will come back if we need sushi and don't want to head over to Seattle. The service we got was good."
1939143,This is a cozy little restaurant with incredibly nice people and fantastic pizza. Can't wait to come back here! :)
1933605,"So, I kind of got dragged into this restaurant after a watching a movie at the theater. I wasn't excited about going here because I have never had dim sum. I'm glad I got convinced into going. 

When you first walk in they have the staff making the dumplings and you can see them through the glass. It's kind of hard not to stare but I was staring for quite a while. They probably thought I was a little creepy. However, that's the best thing about this place... Everything is made fresh daily. I ordered the pork dim sum and the chicken fried noodles. No frozen dim sum or frozen noodles here folks. 

My wife said that the wait and line are usually long here. I think we came at a great time on Sunday evening because we were able to get seated quickly. Plus the wait staff were very kind and kept looking out for us. 

We finished our dinner off with a shaved ice dessert. This was Amazing!!! See my pictures. It was huge and delicious. It fed 3 people and everyone loved it.

I will be coming back here again to get some more of that dim sum and probably another shaved ice!"
817989,I really loved the vegetarian combo platter. It was delicious and filling.
1772765,"The food is absolutely delicious. The portions are huge. The staff is friendly. We've always ordered takeout so I cannot speak to the service, but based on the quick and tasty service, I give it a 5/5!"
902851,Amazing slices and even better staff!
246010,"The food was alright when I ate there ... but they advertise shark fin soup on the menu.  I'm sorry, but shark finning is not only animal cruelty, but toxic as well.  Shark meat can have up to three times the mercury content that other fish have.  I don't care how good the food is, any restaurant that serves shark fin soup deserves a ban and an investigation by the authorities.  In fact, I think I'll petition to do just that."
1652196,"Great views of Lake Union at eye level includes yachts, seaplanes, and kayaks. But the view is only the beginning. Brunch at Chandler's is a calming, delicious experience. Your meal comes with fruit, coffee cake, and apple fritters. The staff is professional, prompt, and attentive, but not overly-so.

The food can run a little buttery at times, but that's a rare occurence. The seafood is extremely fresh and you'll find Chandler's to be a standout experience."
918192,"I was pretty disappointed with my experience here. The food was bland and some of it was overcooked. The service was practically nonexistent and they wouldn't give me chopsticks even after I asked, despite giving them to other people in my party (I'm assuming because I'm white). Also, the prices were really high for what you get. There are so many other Chinese restaurants in the International District that I definitely would not come back. I don't mind higher prices or a lack of service if the food rocks, but this place lacked all three."
878192,"The place is pretty spacious but during lunch it fills up and is quite busy. They have a good selection and they keep the conveyor belt populated.  The service isn't bad, but when busy you usually need to flag down a waiter. And you can always make specific orders if you don't see what you want. There are a bunch of non sushi items also like popcorn chicken, sesame balls, edamame, mochi ice cream, pie, and such."
878593,"This place lives up to the hype. I'm not a fan of the sour dough bread that's big in the west coast, but the soup itself was really good. Best I've ever had? I can't say. But it's definitely worth waiting in a long line for."
1447569,Love palace but it doesn't blow my mind like some other tom Douglas restaurants do. Three stars automatically for the coconut cream pie. No joke. I mean it. One of the best desserts in my life. Some of the food is memorable here but still the menu could use some expansion in main course selection. Very rich cuisine across the board and the hodge podge interior could use a little facelift after all these years. Have and would go back.
837347,Larb was gross. It was gritty and the lettuce wilted before it even got to my door. Pad See Ew great like always. Panang was okay.  It seems to be hit and miss with great here.
885826,"Great vibe, older crowd. Took family for dinner. Has a decent kids menu. Had the hummus appetizer-new taste cucumber and hummus. The brick chicken was very good with an excellent rice and almond dish. The separation of their Arnold Palmer was the best I've ever seen."
901441,Awesome place!!! Great food and service
833020,"Must visit Place. It is a small place, but they will take care of you. Have some patience and you will feel, it was worth."
1514712,"I am a little skeptical about the ""cool"" burger joints in Seattle, but this place is close to home.. and it has Molly Moon's ice creams, so I gave it a shot.

I thought the food was  great. I don't eat huge portions, so the smaller hamburger was just the right size. I thought the meat tasted fine. It wasn't a grease bomb (think Five Guys), but it wasn't a boring burger (sorry Red Mill). The fries tasted actually like - gasp - potatoes, although they were a little thinner than I generally prefer. I didn't find the burger to be excessively overpriced. 

The service has always been nice when I visited. Both times we took a while to decide exactly what to get, and the employees were quick to ask if we needed any help or had any questions. I've never felt unwelcome there.

All in all, Lil Woody's provides a solid experience."
887467,"At first, the food at this place will taste good, but do not let ourself be fooled.  Most restaurants use salt to enhance the flavor of foods.  However, this place seems to be adding tons of salt to lure more customers.  That seems to be an old tactic of restaurants to gain more customers.  I want to give them a chance, however, and let them know.  Overall, food is good but too salty.  Portions are good, and price could be slithy better.  Remember, salty = hight blood pressure and other illnesses."
2158139,Amazing breakfast with generous portions and a friendly attentive staff. It seemed they knew many customers by name and they are always in a good mood. I look forward to becoming one of the regulars at this quaint little spot.
2154302,"Great sushi. Even better happy hour. The atmosphere is a little bourgeois for my liking, but that's just personal taste I suppose. Overall I was completely satisfied and I'll be going here often."
997136,"I LOVE the idea of this place, and I used to come here frequently. A nice place where board gamers can get together and play? Fantastic. 

However the execution is highly lacking. 

First of all, this place is ALWAYS packed. In and of itself, not a terrible thing, except there's no seating whatsoever. There are two rooms you can reserve, but they're almost always booked. You can't do any other sort of reservation. When you enter, sometimes there's a sign that says ""Please wait to be seated"", but usually there isn't, so you have no indication to know that there is a wait. 

You can put your name on a list, but the staff won't tell you where you are on the list (sometimes there can be three tables ahead of you, which in a place where everyone plays games, can be a long wait) nor do they even attempt to give you an estimate as to how long the wait will be. Nothing. Just take your name and leave. 

Also, the service here has really gone downhill. I understand the staff is really stressed out because it's so busy, but it's really a turn off. The food is surprisingly pricey (though tasty). 

The last time we were here was pretty ridiculous. A 2.5hr wait with no idea even how many tables were ahead of us, coupled with rude service once we were seated, tripled by a guy taking up an entire booth to himself for 3 hours and none of the staff saying anything= not coming here as much anymore."
2132620,Great impromptu date spot. Walked over here after a few drinks at beveridge place and had a wonderful dinner with my girlfriend. We loved it!
970883,"Underwhelming. Kinda sad... Hubs ordered a burger that was pretty good. I ordered a salad with their ""famous"" slow cooked pulled pork or --whatever. It came with a cute presentation of an upside down chilled mug of salad. I was all excited. But, the meat was stringy and overcooked like shoelaces. And for $15, I ate just the salad part. Not a great deal. We thought dessert would be better (brownie ala mode.) Two dry little brownie formations with random grocery store grade ice cream and almost no fudge sauce. 

This isn't a bad place for the area. It's got a cute feel and it might be a decent place for a fast launch coming back or going to the airport. But, not nice enough for dinner or a vacation meal. It is what it is."
1117321,"So I was supposed to meet my friend by 5:30 for dinner... he's stuck in traffic and I'm STARVING so I tell him I'm going to wait inside. I made reservations for 5:35-45 pm and the place seems to be having a large party and some small tables.

The interior of this restaurant is quite pleasing to look at(:

The lighting ambience fits in well for a higher-end Italian restaurant. Would be a cute place for a dinner date. Maybe a bit too dark for lunch? It kinda kills the sunlight that usually shines during the afternoon.

Like most places, I was given some french bread? Maybe sourdough, I got too hungry and started chowing down on bread (how rude of me hehe). I only ate one piece while I wait for my uncle. 

He's still not here.. I get asked by the kind server if I would like anything to drink, I might as well wait and order a glass of wine (: but I decided to munch on the bread and wait. 

Finally arrived, after what seemed like hours, since I was so hungry. 

We ordered the Torta Di Formaggio as an appetizer, I was kind of skeptical since I don't like goat cheese [had one experience before this] but my friend seemed to enjoy it quite deliciously

Unfortunately, I forgot to write down what our main courses were called but we both had chosen something from the ""specials"" list so it wouldn't be on the main menu. Mine looked like pumpkin stuffed raviolis with scallops in a creamy sauce with some asparagus. It was yum, I love stuffed pastas. My friend ordered something that looked like penne pasta with meat crumbs [I know,this sounds super unprofessional] in a tomato-based sauce I think. His was a bit salty. I didn't prefer it much. Both entrees did come with a small side salad which was good as well.

We both ordered two glasses of Moscato D' Asti, which has become my new favorite white wine because it was pleasant to my taste buds. Speaking of sweet, we ordered a dessert which I also cannot find on the menu, it seemed a bit like Gelato, or creme fraiche maybe? with raspberry puree and some fruits on top. It was delicious. I want to go get some more now. 

Overall, it was a good dining experience, if I could go again, I would but it is a bit of a stretch on the price range for myself personally. [Luckily, I didn't have to pay for dinner]."
829459,"This is standard Thai food. I've always gotten well prepared food here, but there is nothing ""spectacular"" about it. The service can be iffy (slow even when the restaurant is nearly empty), but friendly. I'd skip bringing young children, as the atmosphere is not very (young) kid-friendly. Favorite menu items: Spring rolls, Pad Thai, Chicken Satay (My kids' favorite here), Summer Fire, Pad Woon Sen, Red Curry and Massamun Curry. Bottom line: decent food, good prices, and you'll have leftovers to take home. Great atmosphere, too!"
20447,Amazing. good sized portions and really fresh seafood. The smoked tuna salad is my favorite. The gnocci and linguine are amazing too. Surpisingly well priced for the quality and amount of food.
547018,"I wanted taquitos, bf had a living social deal, there we went. I was a little disappointed by the taquitos--they were a little cripsy, and I prefer a softer tortilla, but that is just my personal preference. I'm not sure if this was orderer error, but I had one potato taquito and two with meat when I ordered (or at least told bf to order) the chicken ones. 

However. BF got a sampler of each enchilada with a tangy tomatillo salsa on top, and oh my goodness, I want more already. I will be back. I don't think I could pick a favorite of the three fillings."
1127134,"Birthday dinner @ Serafina was a treat! While I didn't enjoy the calamari appetizer as much as I thought I might, the beet gnocchi, ravioli, and scallop dishes were delicious. The Isola cocktail was very tasty, and the sunset in he courtyard was warm and inviting.  All the waitstaff were very attentive.  We would go here weekly if we could."
829760,"I've been here many times over the years and it's one of my favorite hangouts.  Great relaxed atmosphere, good beer selection, and the food is excellent.  I love the salmon sandwich!  Their other location on Queen Anne--the Hilltop Ale House--is just as good."
1290747,"Husband and I had one of the best dinners there last Saturday , waitress was so knowledgable on steaks and the menu, wine choice is unbelievable , wide selection.  I think this may become my favorite restaurant"
1012496,This is the best Chinese restaurant in Seattle. The ingredients are always fresh and right from the market. It always tastes delicious & healthy. Delivery is always prompt & very friendly. We love this place!
2788195,"Not just your bagel place for breakfast. They also have a good variety of sandwiches on their lunch menu. I had the turkey sandwich- it was very tasty. Bagels are good but not your typical NY bagel. Close though- bagels have that NY chewy on the inside but doesn't quite have that crunchy outside crust that a typical NY bagel would have.  I also bought some bagels to take home. They're good even the next day. Just had to toast it a bit. 
The owners and staff are really nice. They always greet you and serve you with a smile.  
Most of the tables and decorations are either refurbished or recycled. The owner has some good stories about them. 

Clean, friendly service and good food makes this place a keeper."
913227,"Maybe that was Friday evening, I think the they were too busy to take a good care of us. The sauce plates  were put on the table with bottom soaked up with the sauce. Nobody was coming to refill the tea. Plus, not so friendly....

Food is fine. All you can eat meat."
1700031,"Fantastic draft beer selection that rotates regularly with a good mix of local and good out of town craft beers. The hot dogs are tasty, especially the classic Tacoma Dog."
1428146,"OMG, i love this place. The Chirashi bowl was GREAT!!!! The sashi were so thick and fresh. I found all the money worth it in this tiny restaurant in U Dist. I'm an Uni lover and their uni was amazing. 

Wish I have a bigger tummy to put more food in it. I heard that there's one in Bellevue, and would love to go there to see if the food are the same. LOL"
1340381,"I love pizza. I could eat pizza every day. I wish pizza was a healthy food so I was required to eat 2 servings a day.

I finally made it here and had to be on the ""call"" list, which took about an hour to get a call back. I booked it back from where I was drinking to eat. I'm not a fan of shared tables but I went with it. The pizza was great! I am a big fan of chewy, soft bread. We got the margarita pizza, salad, and drinks. I had wished I ate here sooner. It's not a pizza dive so you have to pay for gourmet pizza. 

The location and long wait times has made it so I haven't returned but some day soon."
975842,Food is OK. Place is nice.
975769,"Calamari was sauggy like a sauggy French fry. The atmosphere is romantic, and quiet. Our entres were very good. Cioppino and salmon salad were both very good. Nothing farm fished, some of it flash frozen,but still very fresh tasting. I might go back, mostly for the atmosphere and to try a few more menu items, but my husband and I spent about 24 to 29 bucks a dish it was expensive and the calamari was a letdown."
1774057,"This place never disappoints me. I came here again and tried other amazing dishes. The foods are flavorful and fresh as always. Honestly, I'm not a fan of fish; however the deep fried catfish doesn't taste fishy and the anchovy sauce was so good. 
P/S: I was surprised,  for the restroom is super clean eventhough one of the previous comment indicated that it wasn't."
1965246,Delicious authentic food for a great price.  Portions were huge and service was fast.  Will definitely be going back.
1135617,Ryan and I enjoy the BBQ pork won ton noodle soup! Yum!
1065396,"we were quickly seated at around 1:45 pm. for lunch.  then we waited, and waited, and waited for our drinks,  appetizers and entrees.

recommendation:  this must be a happy hour drinks and appetizer establishment. maybe salads for lunch.
great interior decor. inviting and bistro-y and designed to take advantage of high energy noise level. 

two groups of business lunchers were leaving as we arrived. the dining area was empty except for the two of us. our waitress informed us about the availability of patio dining but we declined because it was so warm that day we preferred the cooler indoor dining.

we ordered three appetizers: the plantain chips, bolsillo picante and shrimp ceviche and the chile relleno entree and the churrasco entree and the mango mojito.

the plantain chips arrived nearly 20 minutes after we placed our order. we were promised that the rest of our order will arrive ""soon"". the plantain chips were well cooked although the ""sol sauce"" seemed to be the wrong match to the lovely plantain chips. nevertheless, i liked the sol sauce enough to take home. the chips reminded me of the chips i would buy from street vendors in panama which is a good memory.

the mango mojito came out 10 minutes after. gosh, should the drink not be one of the first to be delivered to the table so that maybe there would be time to order a second drink?

the bolsillo picante arrived at least another 10 minutes after the mojito. although the deep fried filled pastries were tasty and the peppers had a nice spicy kick, the ""mixture of cheeses""  was nothing more than cream cheese. but the price was right at  $5.00

the shrimp ceviche arrived after another ten minutes or so after the bolsillo picante. the ceviche was not as tangy and limey as i am used to but the shrimp was perfectly tender and sweet and not over cooked in the in lime juice. the shrimp was a larger shrimp that was cut into bite sizes and not the teeny tiny ""salad"" shrimp. a win!

we watched armloads of food heading to the patio area during the hour or more we waited for our entree. i finally went to check out the patio and saw at least 8 tables of parties of two to six.  i peeked into the kitchen: 1 cook. the bartender and the waitress were double-dutying and helping in the kitchen. no wonder we were still waiting for our entrees after an hour. a simple acknowledgment and even an apology for the slow service would have made our experience acceptable.

the good news is that it was obvious that every order was made to order.
we waited in anticipation and baited breath for our entrees.

my chile relleno arrived after well over an hour after we ordered.  the plate was a grilled poblano split open with minced chorizo and some kind of a warm salsa. 
the ""mixture of cheeses"" from the menu was again, cream cheese.  the ""bold tomato sauce was....not. as you can see from the photo i posted, to me, it was pretty much a muddled mess.
our waitress explained that this chile relleno is not the mexican style; that this is  south american style.  there are many countries in the south american continent but she was unable to tell me which south american country this ""chile relleno"" represented . chile relleno *is* mexican.  it seems to me this dish should have been named:  xxxx country grilled chile with special sauce with cream cheese.  try googling "" south american style chile relleno"".
the black beans and the rice were tasteless and bland and needed some salt.

the churrasco, although quite impressively presented was bland. needed some salt.  the fries were freshly made, but the vegetables were under cooked. 

i had sympathy for the single cook in the kitchen and the staff of two who had to attend to an unusual and unexpected lunch crowd on an wednesday as i was told by our waitress. a simple acknowledgement to us waiting, and waiting and waiting would have been appropriate. 

so again i ask this question: what's with these restaurants that will not put salt and pepper on the table? no matter how much the chef believes his/her taste to be impeccable, it probably is not, and if someone would like to add some salt, that should be ok. it's not like i am dining at the french laundry, and i bet there is a salt cellar on the table there.

i want to to rate Sol a 3 but all we needed was for our waitress to acknowledge our wait. our wait for our food was beyond the pale. i asked if there was a short staff problem in the kitchen and was told that this day was an unusually busy lunch hour.
the ""unusually"" bad day for you is also a bad day for me. this one bad day and how it is handled determines if i will return to give the restaurant a second chance. if service is a challenge then customer service can make the difference.

the appetizers were at least a 3 star but the entrees and the service rates 2 stars."
2165707,"Our burgers were fantastic, and VERY large. Honestly, kind of difficult to get your mouth around the whole thing. The choice of meats and toppings is pretty amazing. I tried the dork (duck and pork) and it was really tasty and different, in a good way.  One of my pals calls herself a burger purist (she only wants cheese and ketchup, and that ketchup better be heinz. Ha!). And she friggin LOVED it.  Got the super burger/kobe beef.  And she was so so excited to get to pick her own cheeses (she ordered both cheddar AND havarti). 

The shakes arrive in beakers, which is adorable, with some fun flavor combinations, as well. The peppermint chocolate was delicious, although the 4 hard peppermint candies floating in it weren't very useful.  How does one eat a hard candy while drinking a shake? A friend suggested I suck on the candy while drinking, but that seemed awkward in mixed company. If they were crumbled peppermint or candy cane pieces, that would've worked better.

There's a daily macaroni and cheese special. It was SO rich and divine! *drool*  Food portions are pretty dang large."
1160398,"We went to Fins before a show as I am guessing most people do since it's connected to the theater, making it a convenient choice for OK food/wine. 

The food was just OK, we had the mussels, the Black & Blue Ahi appetizer and the Crab Louie salad. The wine list is good, they have some reasonable prices by the glass and bottle. The service was great, our server was very attentive and aware we were on a time crunch.

The atmosphere is nice, I like the exposed brick and candles on the tables. Overall, I would go here again before a show but not sure I would seek out a dinner here otherwise."
2122638,"LOVE this place. The guys who run Mr. Gyro's are the friendliest guys I've ever met, and they're easy on the eyes too. ;-) The place is always buzzing--I think the word is out that this is THE place for gyros, but service is speedy so the wait is never long.

I can't speak to the meat dishes since I'm a vegetarian, but the veggie stuff is A-mazing. I usually get the falafel plate to go, which is a huge box filled with the tastiest falafel ever, hummus, olives, greek salad, rice, and warm pita bread. I don't remember if you get dolmas with this plate, but I've had them from here and they were tasty too! I've also heard the garlic fries are crazy good, and everything is priced very reasonably.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you're in Greenwood--there's not much seating in the place, but turnaround is typically quick, or grab an order to go, and stuff yourself in the privacy of your own home. They also opened a second location in Ballard which I hear has later hours."
1909843,"It really is all about the view here.  On a nice day you can't beat the skyline view of Seattle.  The service is very friendly, but the food is just okay.  For the price I really would expect it to be on par with one of the finer seafood establishments in the area.  Go for the view at happy hour, than dine elsewhere."
774214,Dirtiest yet most colorful block in Seattle. Worth checking out. Just don't touch anything!
900324,"You know, people always told me that this place was ridiculously expensive and not worth it, and it kept me away for seven years, but before leaving Seattle, I put it on my bucket list. Totally worth it. 

Went on a beautiful day (yay July) so the view was, of course, amazing. Got seated in an amazing table by the window. They are all really ""by the window"". Even the booths are positioned so that everyone get's a commanding view. There really aren't any ""bad seats"". In fact, the booths may even be better than the window seats...

Saturday and Sunday are Brunch, not lunch and dinner. That was the only snafu for us. Its a $45 prix fix menu, so we ended up ordering more than we wanted. Then again, being forced into those delicious desserts wasn't so bad. 

People said that the food isn't that good, but I heard they brought in a new cook a couple years back that really brought the quality up. The latter part is correct. The food is top notch! I had the prime rib with mashed potatoes for brunch and my girlfriend had the jandori chicken. Both cooked and seasoned perfected. The shrimp appetizer was amazing as well. We stayed away from the pure breakfast dishes, and that seemed to be a good call, as the more lunch/dinner selections on the brunch menu seemed much more impressive than what was getting served elsewhere. 

Our waiter was super nice. There was definitely a rush to get us to order at the beginning, but he didn't bother us at all once our order was in, and we stayed and enjoyed the view a good while. Then it was up to the observation deck for our ""free"" tour of that as well. 

One more tip, when your done with the observation deck, head back down to the restaruant and catch the elevator from there instead of waiting in line upstairs. One of the perks of paying $100 to come up the space needle..."
2645766,"This little nook has it all - atmosphere, local, great choices - including alternative (vegan, GF, etc).

I was gonna get the burger, but my server Bambi recommended the korean pork sandwich and I was not disappointed. I can't figure out what part was my favorite."
1704169,"The gyros are superb, cheap and the man that makes them is always so kind. We lived in Lake City 3 years ago and just moved back, and this place was on the list to revisit...Now that we live pretty close again, we get them to go on a regular basis and I'm never disappointed.

The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is one of those little holes in the wall worth trying for sure!"
12189,"Mmmmmmmm..... that's the 1st thing that comes to mind when I think about Shakabrah, then the immediate thought after is, hmmmm, I wonder how busy they are and do I feel like waiting or not. GO figure!!

I have been here a handful of times and I have to say that I do my best in trying to support small, local businesses but the service always tends to kill it here as it came be either the best or the god awful worst!!!

Since this is a local hangout of sorts, you may have to wait for a table for quite sometime. The longest I have ever waited was 45 minutes but I prepared myself and thankfully wasn't starving but generally speaking you have to time it right when coming here or else you will waiting to get a table and then once you order it's wait time again for the food. 

Now the reasons why I gave them 4 stars in their food, the variety and multiple options. The Shaka potates are AH-MAZING!!! I always opt for the ""magic"" they are delicious. The pancakes are just that, CAKES and you can hook them up however you want:) My daughter ordered her cakes with bacon and was super excited to know that they weren't just going to be crumbled on top but actually mixed into her pancake!!! Omelettes are delicious here, I have had the Spinach Feta, YUM!!! You can't go wrong with there biscuits and gravy as well.. And you can't forget the $5 Mimosa that comes in a large 16oz glass, no flutes over here!!! I have yet to try the Asian Mary but my coworker raves about  them... maybe next time."
2682475,"Burrata: Creamy mozzarella with tomatoes on the side. Great!

Focaccia: The side order was an entire LOAF of focaccia that consisted of 12 pieces. The waitress should have told us the size in advance. Regardless, it was wood-fired and was really good, with and without the burrata.    

Via Tribulani Pizza: This non-traditional rectangular pizza was very tasty. It had NO SAUCE and was served with tomatoes, arugula, and mozzarella on top. The rest of the ""toppings"" were stuffed inside the wood fired crust.

Margherita Pizza: Thin-crust, wood fired, and great flavor.  

Note: You must to ask for a pair of pizza-scissors to cut the pizza into slices. Fun/interesting gimmick."
666922,Busy.  Always busy with a line.  But there is indeed a reason.  Because it's freak'n great.  Best tacos you'll find in Bremerton.  Seriously.  Don't believe me? Prove me wrong.  Go for it.  This is a battle you're sure to lose.
2755090,"Absolutely delicious Cuban sandwich.  If you want one, get there early and don't go when you are in a hurry because there will be a long line.  I don't know why they don't make more, because they run out every day.  I also love their chicken and rice dishes."
161353,"awesome selection; killer view, food is solid & the service is better!"
1969988,"Great pizza.  really pretty fantastic and eclectic and cool.  i'd say romantic, but my GF says its too loud to be romantic.  here's a tip, try the house red, and see if  you can't substitute one ingredient for another (they seem to be pretty cool about that). If you don't like Pizza, don't go here, b/c besides salad, your choices are calzone, lasagna (meat only) and tube shaped past with bolognaise sauce.  oh yeah, and Parking is going to be tough."
827038,Was extremely surprised to find such a good indian restaurant this far south.  Great food and great service.
993498,"The food at this place is amazing, just remember to make reservations and to never sit at the bar, the bartenders are very unfriendly and snobby. We've been to this place many times and the food gets better and better. Their pork belly is awesome and the flat breads ( any of them ) are amazing as well."
886767,"This place is a great stop for happy hour. Their happy hour is week round, no matter what time, so you can always get a good deal on a cocktail or an appetizer. I definitely recommend one of their flat breads; all of them are delicious. There may be a wait, as it gets really busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights. I've never had a bad drink or dish here! I also recommend the doughnut holes. They are home made!"
949998,Delicious gluten free pizza! They get the crust nice and crispy. My number one complaint with gluten free pizza is that the crust is often under cooked. This place gets it right. One of my friends who is not gluten free even thinks their gluten free pizza is better than regular pizza and you probably will too if you like a thin crust pizza. I've had both pick up & delivery. The delivery was quick for a Friday night (less than their quoted time even).
848415,"I have been here a pretty alarming number of times in the past week (5? 6?) so I feel qualified to write a well informed review. I LOVE this place. I feel like this is something that has been missing from Capitol Hill. I know this sounds a little over the top but, for me, it is kind of transformative in the same way that Cal Anderson Park was. Such a simple concept, but such a big deal: I have a fun place to meet my friends ANY TIME. 

I see a lot of complaints about the service, but I have had no issues. Everyone has been really kind, helpful, and apologetic when things do go wrong. There was a wait for the food, but nothing so outrageous. And the food ranges from decent to really good. The music is great and the crowd has been a diverse and fun mix of people every time I have been. It sounds like the problems people are reporting are pretty natural for a place just getting started up. Patience! I really feel like this is something great in the making!"
846562,"We stopped in here the other day before hitting the new location of MOHAI. The service was friendly and fast. Before your meal you get a basket of warm sourdough bread slices with butter. Mmmm...it was very good; especially when you are hungry and it's a bit chilly outside. Their red chowder was tasty, but not much different than the chowder I make at home (and I'm a mediocre cook). Their breaded calamari steak strips were okay. A bit soggy and the side dips were a bit bland. However, the cole slaw that came w/ this appetizer was very good.

I will return because of their awesome wait staff!"
1286103,Awesome mojitos... love the sliders and the carne frita.
981652,"Have been there twice, this place has some really delicious food! Its fast food, but you can tell everything is fresh and it has not been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Highly recommended."
832967,"Excellent eggs benedict, and a free latte with a checkin on yelp!!

Definitely the small hipster joint, but the average hipster age was 63..."
1956196,"Two stars for having a nice restaurant and good service. Phad Thai was pretty red (ketchup) and the other dish similar to Thai basil, but very little basil and bell peppers. I would give a better rating if they redo their phad Thai recipe to be more authentic and fresh."
1439466,"Had a fantastic dinner at JW's and left almost full after a 3 course meal of pineapple crusted prawns, an amazing cut of halibut and a chocolate mousse with raspberries in an edible chocolate shell. My wife had a salad, lobster crusted fillet Mignon and chocolate cheesecake with raspberries. A long stem rose capped off the great evening for her to smell on the ride home.

It was quite loud where we were sitting, so it was almost impossible for us to have a conversation, which is why I knocked it down to 4 stars. Also, for $120/couple I think a 2nd course salad should be offered and then add another item to choose from other than the prawns next time. We saw our appetizers come out and were delivered to the opposite table, taken back and left out for a good 5 min before they figured out where to go. My prawns were still hot luckily so other than the extended wait, it was fine.

No military discounts."
747751,"Love this place! I think this is our favorite in Ellensburg. Good comfort food, amazing bread (YOU MUST GET THE HEAVENLY LOAF), perfect burger, nice selection of local brews, good stuff for the kids, and my wife likes the veggie options. 

The Dark Lager from Roslyn Brewing Company paired with the Blue kobe Burger was one of the best dinners I have had out in a long time. And then we finished it with outstanding carrot cake...
We will keep coming back!"
1308295,"Great location and love the downstairs location. It's probably not handicap accessible (unless there's an elevator I don't know about), but for those of us who can walk down stairs, it's a nice hidden gem. 

I had a vegetarian soup which was delish, although I was still a bit hungry after eating it. Service was exceptional and I like all their decorations. 

There is only one toilet in the ladies room which could be a bit of a problem. 

Overall, I really like this restaurant and am looking forward to coming back. Since I'm not a huge fan of Indian food this is a huge complement."
854766,"Unfortunately I didn't get to eat during my experience here because I was on a diet. However this gave me the opportunity to really be keen to my surroundings. This place is actually really elegant. The flow of water in the man made pond on the middle of the main dinning area.  The lights and the style of  the lights as the hang down from the ceiling. GREAT ATMOSPHERE! Perfect for dates and groups for birthdays/parties.

Now even there service was stupendous. It wasn't jam packed or anything but was still a good night of customers from the way i saw it and the servers were there to help serve us at every turn. 

Only reason I'm giving this a 4 star rating is because I did not taste the food. But it looked amazing and I really wanted too. Thumbs up for me if you want a good date or taking a group out! 

EMINOUT"
805765,"I've been eating here for years and the BBQ is good....not great by any stretch of the imagination.  I've come to know the people who run it and today was a whole new ballgame.  All new people from what i saw. Hmmmm, First, the prices are all jacked up....well okay, everything is going up.  Second, I ordered my usual mild pulled pork...and I couldn't believe that there was at least double the amount of sauce and half the amount of meat.  It was R E A L L Y disappointing.  The buns were so saturated with sauce that they were a big glob of oniony flavor BBQ sauce.  The pork was okay, but they literally had a tiny portion of it.  I came home and was hungry for something to eat...an hour later.  I'll remember to cross this off my list of places to go for quite awhile."
1185986,"My Sailors are always going to this place for lunch and this time we decided to go as a celebratory luncheon.  I ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger and the garlic fries.  I added pastrami to my burger.  After my first bite I had to take the pastrami off my burger because it was terrible...afterwards it was only edible.  The garlic fries were okay...not really sure why my guys are always going to this place because I was greatly disappointed.  However, there was a bright spot and that came from the red velvet cupcake that I took home to the wife.  She claims that it was the best that she had in a long time and is already asking when are we going back for another one."
1133476,"First time there the other morning for brunch! I went with my best friend, we were looking for a good brunch place and she said this place was not bad so why not, right? There wasn't a line which was really nice, previous yelp reviews had hinted there would be some sort of wait. The place was basically an all-american diner, which is kinda nice once in a while. 

We ended up sharing their combo which included eggs, ham, and a choice of either three buttermilk pancakes or hashbrowns w/ toast. We opted for the pancakes, however, they were really dry. We had to drench them with butter and maple syrup to make them even edible! Really disappointing. Maybe cause we didn't get their famous pancakes, like banana with coconut syrup or blueberry...but the pancakes weren't good. We also got a side of hashbrowns for like ~$3. Overall, the eggs were meh, ham was alright, but the hashbrown were yum! Just the way we like them, brown and crispy. I like mine with ketchup :) 

I would probably only come back to try their banana pancakes. But then again, I can make those at home too~"
2151248,"I absolutely love Sitka & Spruce.  I've eaten here a dozen or so times and the dishes never cease to delight my palate.

The raw King Salmon with strawberries I had there on my most recent visit was simultaneously simple and out-of-this-world tasty.

Just a note:  they don't take Discover cards.  A woman at the table next to us found this out the hard way.  Don't be that person!"
873159,"Bahama Breeze Is a restaurant that not only has a great ambiance, but great food too. The Jamaican chicken wings are big, meaty and extremely flavorful. I also got the seafood paella and the conch fritters. The paella was not only the greatest paella I have ever ate, but one of the greatest restaurant meals I have ever had. It was piping hot and was a huge portion size. The conch fritter were tasty but small and small portioned and had more breading then conch. The bahamarita was delicious, the little shot of cactus schnapps on the side was tasty when mixed with the Margarita. I know great food and I go to this restaurant as often as possible. You cant beat the knowledgeable servers that actually don't mind a little conversation and draw a picture on your to go box. You can't beat the beautiful island themed interior and the tropical like exterior with the palm trees and bungalow like look, and you cant beat amazing, hot, beautifully displayed meals. Go to the Bahamas, experience the breeze."
2150408,"Beware: El Camion may be addictive. It was for me. 

I find myself making excuses to go to nearby businesses during meal times, when I am at my peak hunger and I know I won't be able to resist. Obbbviously, I need to make a grocery run to the Safeway a distance away, not the store mere feet from my abode. I leave my dog during the day for work so of COURSE I need to take him to Mud Bay to make it up to him! Not only is it delicious, but it is cheap and quick--a deadly combo if you are trying to cut back. 

I had never had a mulita before El Camion. It was the first dish I ordered, along with a fish taco at the prompting of my friends who had brought me there. For those of you yet to experience the mulita, it is somewhere in between an enchilada, grilled cheese, and a quesadilla in composition, although different from all three. It consists of two corn tortillas laid sprawled in quesadilla fashion, prepared like a grilled cheese sando. Between them is melted white cheese (not sure what kind, but it is creamy and yummy), shredded chicken (your choice), slices of avocado, and the tangy salsa verde.Unable to NOT put some type of sauce on everything I eat, I mix the avocado salsa and the chipotle salsa and drizzle it on top. And there you have it--your saucy quesachelada sandwich. I'm not sure if comparing it to the more pedestrian quesadilla and enchilada would encourage people to try it (because it sounds familiar) or discourage those looking for a more adventurous experience. But I assure you, like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, it combines the elements from each to make something entirely kick-ass. 

It is here that I must admit that I am not the best person to review this in terms of giving an accurate feel for the entire menu. I have tried exactly three things: the mulita, the chicken taco, and the fish taco. The fish taco is probably the dish El Camion is best known for, and it lives up to its fame. The fish is moist, the cabbage crunchy, the sauce adds a creamy element that balances the pico and lime. And it's cheap--only $2 for a decent portion. The chicken taco is pretty basic--just tortilla, chicken, and pico--but add a little (or a lot) of one (or more) of their five different salsas, and you really don't need much more. A mulita and a fish or chicken taco is my tried-and-true, and if one day I venture out of my delicious comfort zone, I will report back. 

Now don't I need to go to the Walgreens on Market for something?"
522737,"The first time I went here over a year ago their sushi selection on the belt seemed so abundant then every time I come back it just got worse and worse selections and quality.

Blue C Sushi is a ""belt"" sushi place. You sit down at at table, booth or counter and the different dishes are put on a conveyor belt that goes all the way around. You see something you like and you simply take it. The sushi chefs are in the center preparing additional entries as they are taken. If you don't see what you want, the wait staff can place orders for you. 

From the belt, I grabbed some ebi (shrimp), gyoza, tuna (for the girlfriend), and some other things. I also ordered some teriyaki chicken and Miso soup. Everything was truly delicious. One interesting thing is the all the plates are color coded and that is how your pricing works. 

Not sure how many times I will go back but if I am downtown, I am sure we will pop in again."
1150105,"I had the best traditional clam chowder I've ever had, and my husband loved the Manhattan style chowder (and he's a SUPER picky eater). 
The special of smoked salmon on pumpkin filled ravioli was to die for!  The service was excellent, with the waiter providing excellent tips and suggestions.  I wish I lived nearby so I could go here all the time!"
1677701,"I had high hopes but they were dashed. They were busy but front of the house was clearly frazzled. Finally we got seated and got an order in, I ordered 3 spicy but when it came back it tasted like 1. However it took ten minutes to find anyone to complain too, and I did not eat because boring Thai is useless. Finally I got some spice to add but I dont forgive getting the spice so wrong, and I dont forgive not checking back at the table in time to fix problems in a reasonable time. 

We have some good  Thai in Lacey so I am not likely to give these people another chance."
804387,Yum yum can I get me some?! The Alaskan is awesome. The pricing is completely set for a tourist trap but it satisfies the craving.
1198121,"Holy cow, this place has the slowest service. This was my second time coming here with family/kids and both times the dining experience took 2 hours. The steak was dry and cold as well. Just a disaster if a place on a Friday night. Don't waste your time."
1687451,"Had the hot pot here with beef, pork, lamb, and fish for $16/person all you can eat.  Overall the portions of meat they gave were very big and the soup was very tasty.  This place is very good for meat eaters.  However if you want more than just meat, it doesnt have much variety.  It only had soft tofu, thick noodles, rice noodles, broccoli, napa cabbage, and tripe.  Not like some other places that give diferent fish balls, mushrooms, and other things.  However they gave us a good plate of delicious dumplings to make up for the lack of variety.  The service was ok, but they didnt come around much."
679029,First time here for business dinner. Excellent service. Fantastic food. Perfect atmosphere. Overall a nearly perfect experience. This might not be a place you would think of for meeting a client but it is very pleasent and reasoable private and quiet.
803128,"There are only 1 or 2 places in the Seattle area that I would even consider eating Dim Sum at and Joi's is one of them. My prime standards when it comes to dim sum restaurants are three things. 

Number One: the food has to be good and at a reasonable price
Joi's dim sum is good and there is a great variety for a good price, although I never really know what the prices are when I pay... I think it turns out to be around 3-4 per dish. Portions are reasonable and their siu mai is tasty. 

Number two: If I walk into a chinese restaurant bathroom and it doesn't make me wanna turn around and gag, that's a huge bonus. 
This place passed.

Three: Their carts and the steamers aren't nast. 
Seriously... been to some of the places around town and when I lean over to check out the cart, there is sometimes that leftover gunk floating in water that makes you wanna lose your appetite a bit. This place doesn't have any of that. 

Their staff in general is efficient and friendly. Some of the cart ladies can be quite pushy when they want to sell you something that has been left on their carts for a while so beware and hold your ground if you really don't want the item! 

Tip: Get the steamed custard buns. They don't cart them around so you'll just have to ask. They are ah-mah-zing. Also, don't go too early... You may be left with food from previous day. Not sure if this happens but I wouldn't be surprised. Go during noon or after to ensure you get the freshest."
158634,"I tend to immediately judge a Mexican restaurant by the quality of their tortilla chips and Josefina's served us some that were on the stale side... I knew from reading some of the reviews that this place should have good food, but I already started to worry.

I ended up ordering Josefina's Favorite which consisted of carne asada, 6 sauteed shrimp, and a chile relleno. When my food was served, it looked really good and didn't have the appearance of being thrown together super fast. I opted for the corn tortillas (which were homemade btw) and started to dig in. Everything tasted excellent!! I could not stop eating until it was all gone.. I was soooo full when I was about 3/4ths the way through but couldn't help myself from finishing it off. 

The shrimp and carne were cooked perfectly and the bits of garlic mixed in with the shrimp was a real nice touch. The chile relleno was among the best I have ever had and I wished there was at least one more on the plate. 

After eating so much I was worried I would have a serious food hangover but nothing of the sort happened! 

The service was nice and friendly and our drinks were filled and our food came out hot and fresh. I would definitely come back here when I'm in the area."
1113315,"It's basic Korean food *shrug*. Nothing spectacular.  The menu is overpriced, service is slow and the wait staff is colder than my glass that sat empty for an hour.  No wonder they are giving such a large discount on Groupon."
1889190,"The staff is really nice and knowledgeable. The food is really good, and they have some really cool drinks.. The atmosphere is really cool as well!"
792096,"Pretty good diner food, for the area. Cheap mimosas for brunch, if that's what you're looking for. All of the servers were a bit on the grumpy side, not sure what that's all about. My sandwich was acceptably good, and everyone else in my party seemed satisfied, as well. Don't know if I'll return in the future."
1159976,"Good quality at a great price. Loved the lamb shank, the gyro meat plate and the koobideh. If I had an qualms about this place, it would be about the koobideh's flavor and portions... thought it was on the small side and could be more flavorful. Not more salty, but flavorful... as in herbs and spices."
195014,"I was vacillating between 3 & 4 stars. Their food is 3 stars but the beers & ales are fantastic- so up to 4 it goes.

We came here for dinner. I got the chop chop salad. It was good, not fantastic, but I tend to be a snooty organic rare-greens salad type person, so you have to take that into account. Portion was huge. Husband had the burger and sweet potato fries, liked the burger, really liked the sweet potato fries.

They have a great selection of local beers and hard ciders and wines, Their beer selection really takes into account that everyone likes something different in their beer (for some reason) so there's a wide range of brews. 

Service was fine. I got the feeling the waitress didn't particularly want to be there, but I certainly feel like that sometimes. Honesty is refreshing.

So if you're out for a good meal and a great drink, or just a good meal, go there. If you want a great meal and don't care about your drink, go elsewhere."
1103661,"If I could, I would eat here everyday. This is the BEST breakfast place in Seattle. The atmosphere, the food, the staff; it's just a fantastic, family atmosphere all around. It is crazy busy most of the time, but that just proves it's a fantastic restaurant. The portions are huge, so you will most likely be taking food home. Once you are seated, they are really fast at getting your food to you. Also, make sure to buy one of their giant cinnamon rolls on your way out. You won't regret it."
1954107,Love. This. Place.
1061562,"Beer selection? Excellent (when the list is updated with what is actually on tap). 
Pub grub? Left a bit to be desired. 
Service? S L O W..."
2160996,"Fun interior - we sat upstairs on the balcony-walk.  Decent lime basil cooler, but not worth the $.  Mandarin chicken and Kung Pao chicken were both great.  The potstickers were the best part though.  I would go again."
2461023,Amazing natural food and excellent service. Would definitely visit again. Had the granola and yogurt and the first square breakfast. Loved it.
879744,This place was great for my son's 14th birthday party!  Erin took good care of our guests.  All the kids and adults were happy and had full tummies at the end.  There was no extra fee to reserve the space.  The pizza was really great.
821646,"First time visit after a coworker said Gordon Ramsey reworked this place lets check it out! Three of us went for a Thursday lunch and I am on expense account (meaning I am stuck with the bill and not a big spender with company money) The menu was brief and expensive. Two of us ordered cheeseburgers and one ordered meatloaf. Three cokes, total bill was $50 with tax & tip. The burger was good but no better than Red Robin or Bobs Burger & Brew. Service was very good and attentive. 
The meatloaf needed to have some seasoning as it was ""bland"".
 I enjoyed the restaurant just don't like $3.00 cokes! This place needs a blue plate special that allows a diner to eat & drink and escape for under $15! I won't say this is a must go to place because I could easily drive by next time."
1913714,"As far as the play area goes, this place is pretty great- safe, padded, and clean. My two year old daughter is a mover, and it's great to have an indoor climbing space during the winter months.

The biggest bummer to me is that they don't allow outside food, and the food served there is kind of expensive and really just not good (The $10 ""panini"" was tiny and not even heated on the inside, and didn't come with any sides).  I would love to go here on a week night with my husband and let my daughter play while he had a nice picnic dinner, but we can't because the bad food is a deterrent."
2197120,happy hour is the best!!!! boka burger is a must and the truffle fries :)
1900089,"Very juicy and flavorful sandwich's! 2nd time been here, first time had the Beef  Cheesesteak this time went with the Chicken version. Both were real good and the service here was pretty good.
For drinks, cant go wrong with the Strawberry Lemonade! Yum! 
Would most certainly recommend this place."
754523,Great sushi and drinks. This place is always crowded as usual. I always get what I expect. Price is a little high but good times whenever I am there.
1001346,The Piano bar is best in class.
2582222,One of my most favorite sushi place to go to and I love to happy hour from 3 to 6 so if you ever want some good sushi this is the place to go to.
1779065,"Excellent.....organic and/or seasonal ingredients, everything was made fresh, and local beers on tap.  We had the meat pie with mashed potatoes and mushy peas and the Shepard pie.  Both were very delicious!  Super convenient location just next to the harbor and casual but nice restaurant."
849720,"I just came from Highscore... spending about $ 45 for 3 shakes, 2 onion rings, 1 fry, a grilled cheese, and two burgers. OK so $15 a pop... not so bad if the food is good. This is my 3rd time at the cafe ... so I knew the cost.   I ordered my things... the two teen aged  boys I brought ordered separately. In the past I have noticed the service is a little slow... and this time too, but for food made from scratch I am willing to wait. My food came... no shake. The boys ordered ... I finally went up and asked for my shake the woman immediately said "" We are a little backed up.  I will check on it."" At that point the boys were the only ones  who had not gotten their food in the restaurant so backup ???? It was 1:30 ish... so not lunch rush by any means. I let that go but was shocked at the immediate denial.. instead of an apology (apparently the customer is not always right at High Score). The boys shakes came... their food came and the onion rings were burnt the young woman said, as she put them on the table ""He said he would remake these if you want. I am not sure why he even put then on there"" One of the boys said ""Could you remake mine too?"" .... the woman responded "" I said I would replace them ... & I will"" WELL for me that was the last straw. I believe people complain a lot about young folks being disrespectful but by the same token are not respectful to them because they are children. She is not too far from remembering what it was like.  So to get respect you earn it. The young man was not disrespectful at all and the young woman was beyond rude. The second orders of onion rings came and most (not all) of those were burned too. I did mention that the fryer may want to be checked... told them I WAS sorry...(why?). the woman said to the young man behind the counter "" Get her a free fry coupon"" ... I told them not to bother as I would not be back. I was really hoping to have a great little small business, burger place in our town but I wonder how long it will last ....? with this service. My previous times were ok and even crowded... my only complaint then was the patio, which is so nice to have but it needs a cleaning...The boys love the games and they may be back for that but OH the opportunity they are missing. We all have off days but ... this was a general attitude. You should not be in the people business if you don't like people."
1687258,"The joint is dirty , Only time I would go here is late at night with no other options."
969117,"Went here and had a couple drinks, which were a bit expensive, but good. Great view  of Lake Union and Seattle on the back porch. Some of the menu items, were very authentic, such as the elotes. Great place if you are looking for a nice view and good appetizers, but for those of you (like me) want authentic mexican food, I would recommend you go elsewhere, as little water seems to be faking it. I like to buy my mexican food from Mexicans not white people!"
1338623,"I was quite pleasantly surprised at the flavor, portion size, vast array of dishes to choose from and quality of the food here.  I was in the area and needed a quick, low-budget eat before heading off to an appointment.  The chicken is super good - perfectly cooked without under or over cooking.  Lots of flavor in the meat and in the fried rice.  I look forward to coming back!"
190260,"5 stars for Pecado Bueno!!
Great tasting food. Outdoor seating with fire pits (they even put purse/coat-hooks on the fire pits). Attentive service (even though it is a pay-first sit down set up, they can hold a tab open and brought food out to us). Music - just loud enough for a lively atmosphere but not so you have to shout over it to converse. Salsa bar. Tasty horchata.
Not only do they have good food paired with great ambiance - what makes Pecado Bueno win me over? They have a $3 House Margarita and their entire menu is reasonably priced!
It looks like they are in the process of completing the second fire pit and also putting up some sort of fencing - I am looking forward to seeing this place when it's finished!"
1091588,Real nice vibe. I informed the gal at the counter that it was my first time and she was super friendly and helpful.  I ordered the eggs Benedict after reading reviews. It was decent. Flavor was good but I couldn't slice through my English muffin. I would give it another shot.  I'm looking forward to trying other items and hanging in that small town diner vibe.
887751,"My purse was strategically stolen from here. If Gameworks cared about their customers they would come up with a way to keep thieves out. The shady thing about this place is that ANYONE can come in and hang out and not play games. ANYONE. They don't have cameras and they don't have security. And I am not the only one who's had their purse stolen here. I have never in my life had my purse stolen, I am a very aware person, these thieves managed to remove it from between us on the game. I will never go back here, it's so 1990's anyway"
666572,"Teddy's has been on my radar for a long time. I got a chance to go there with Thrill the Killer after bike ride from Gasworks to Redhood. We would probably not go to Teddy's if Redhood wasn't under construction. So, Thank you, Redhood for re-opening one day late!

Teddy's burger is AWESOME! I had the original burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is good through every bite, so juicy! And, medium rare is medium rare, not like a lot of burger places, medium rare turns out to be well-cooked. The fries are so good. It's crispy outside and soft inside. The best part about the burger and the fries is that it's so flavorful and you don't really need condiment.  

Teddy's will be my regular spot on the eastside!"
1093384,Be careful ! 4 of us dined there and asked to split the bill in half and put down 2 credit cards . We were each charged the full amount . We noticed this the next day. Upon Notifying Mohammed of the problem he took our credit card numbers and promised to credit each of us half of the bill . He charged us half again! We had to walk into the restaurant for a face to face discussion in order to get our money back . How do you run a restaurant for 16 years and not know how to process credit cards ? Is this a scam that they run hoping that people don't notice the dollar amount ?? Be careful and double check!
1910044,We came on a Sunday mid day--was not that busy yet we sat for over 15 min waiting to be seated. Then we had to wait another 12 min just to have our order taken. Then what a shocker our pizza took over 20 min! Meanwhile the music kept getting louder and louder till even our son was covering his ears....definitely horrible service and a horrid experience --in the end the server finally apologized and got us a discount. Not a good experience but I am at least happy that they fixed it
2151617,"I came here with my brother, boyfriend, and dad on recommendation to try the Korean fried chicken so I don't have to go all the way Federal Way for it, but after my experience, I would rather drive to Federal Way than come back here again.

First, this is not to say that the fried chicken was bad. It was fine, although I feel like I have had better Korean fried chicken.

Second, I know we were in Redmond, but these prices were at least $2-5 more than what I could get at any other Korean restaurant in the area.

Third, service was slow and the lady who was waiting on us wasn't very nice. I think it's one thing to not be nice when you have a bunch of young looking adults (even though they should be nice to everyone, I know that's not how it goes in Korean restaurants). But to not be nice and courteous when my dad is with us? No, I won't stand for it.

But lastly, adding rice costs extra. Are you kidding me? Maybe it was because we just got fried chicken, but still, you're going to charge extra for rice? Rice is super cheap, I don't think penny pinching on that is going to make people happy.

For those who want Korean fried chicken, don't mind the overpriced menu, and don't want to drive far from the eastside I highly recommend this place. Otherwise, take your business elsewhere."
1084413,"Are you kidding me? Deep dish pizza with a cheese-crust?? Yes PLEASE. And another one to go, please. 

Note that the wait for a pizza pie is about 45 minutes, but it's worth the wait if you're ready for it. We came in hungry to start with (they brought a bowl of popcorn to the table) and when we read that it's a 45 minute wait for a pizza, we were a bit disappointed - However, when the pizza arrived and we took our first bite, it was well worth the wait. 

Also note that it reheats well - and that's a good thing because MAN that pizza is heavy. I ate one and a half pieces before I was stuffed.

Overall, I'd go back - 4 Stars!"
811832,Good ice.
1323244,"Came here after there was too long of a wait at our original restaurant plan. 

Really enjoy the environment and that the dining rooms are sectioned off from the bar - keeps it quieter and more comfortable. Our server was nice but seemed very distracted and rushed; asked if we knew what we wanted before we even ordered drinks, took two of our plates off the table before we were finished, forgot one of our drinks, etc. My husband said his burger was alright, and my Ahi salad was also decent - too little fish, too much cilantro (and I LIVE cilantro). We would both order differently next time and try to not come on a Friday night. 

All in all, it's priced decently and the food IS what you pay for... You just expect it to be more for the fancy, modern environment. My husband also wants me to add that this review borders on 3 stars for the beer selection."
820590,"This was a first time experience for me and my boyfriend. We found this place from a livingsocial deal we bought. 

We arrived 30min earlier than our reservation, luckily it wasn't busy at all and they were happy to seat us. I asked the server to explain how dinner was being served and she was nice about explaining it. 

After she left, I realized we had no utensils or plateware to start off with for the salad bar. We waited about 15 minutes, and with no sign of where the server was, I decided to just get up and find her. With no luck, I headed back to our table and on the way grabbed utensils from a nearby table. 

Within a couple of minute later, she arrived with plates. Luckily I grabbed my own utensils, so off to the salad bar we go. The two stars all go to the salad bar. What an assortment! There was so much to choose from. I think by the end of the night, I had three plate full of salad bar items. 

Now, to talk about the meats. Someone comes around offering to slice off a piece of meat - lamb, bacon wrapped steak, pork, beef, etc. The meat was okay. Nothing too exciting. The person offering the meat would leave some blood juice all over the edge of the table, which was fine because it was only the two of us sitting on a four person table. 

I did enjoy the salad bar, but it was the most pricey salad bar that I have eaten. Luckily we had the livingsocial voucher, or I would have been upset paying the full price of the meal."
1480559,Average Food. Non-friendly service. Overpriced. Music too loud for conversation.
295725,"Was happy to see the friendly staff, attentive service and delicious food!  Excited to see how things continue to improve!"
874603,Service sucked. Everything was too salty. Very disappointing! Especially since the high prices don't match the crappy food and drinks. Oh and the server grabbed a pitcher of water from a table that just left and gave it to us... Gross!!!!
1687869,GHETTO!!!  This place seem like food poisoning waiting to happen. The interior is dirty and old. The food does not look fresh and neither is the taste. Looked at the sushi and kept walking. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a better experience.
883211,"Yum. I got the Mediterranean Marvel. It was peeerrfectly cooked. The burger was juicy and each ingredient's flavor carried. The bun absorbed all the juices and just made the experience that much better. 

Can we also talk about the drink options. The milk shakes are fantastic, but you can also get TANG! What...is that still around? Well anyway, it is kinda fun just to bring back childhood memories but now add the EtOH!

Price is good for what you get. We ate outdoors, not the best location for view. Indoor sitting looked fun! I will be going back some day."
816580,"The food was yummy ~ compares to Red Robin in the burger comparison, Bob's has  more variety of burgers, the burgers are yummy at both, the fries however are also yummy at both but here's the difference, at Red Robin they have endless steak fries but they only come ask you if you want more after you've finished your burger, I think they do that on purpose so you will say no, at Bob's they have med cut fries and give you what I would say is three helpings, also if you get cheese sticks it isn't 4 like most places, it was several, the marinara was yummy too.  The waitress keep the drinks coming.  The bill was less than a Red Robin trip as well, we also had a coupon in our local addies for $7.00 off of two entrees with two drinks purchase.  The initial greet was off but we think maybe they were training new greet and seaters, the service was great otherwise and the food was super yummy!  I would say skip Red Robin and head to Bob's Burgers and Brew!  : )"
1170576,"Terrible, rude service! Very salty food! I went to Bella Italia in December 2011 at around 5pm and the place was pretty much empty.  There were 3-4 waitresses doing nothing! They were just standing there talking!  One of the waitresses spill water and the drips were falling down from her hand to my friend's dish!  She did not apologize and walked away! It was disgusting and food was salty! I will never eat here again! yuck!"
249039,"Had the sliders, macaroni and cheese, and hushpuppies.  Food was adequate, but nothing spectacular.  Service was only adequate as well."
988287,"I really didn't like their thai food here. Didn't seem authentic or good at all. They used asian sweet and sour sauce for their pad see ew while all the other thai places used soy sauce or some other dark sauce. 

Their Pad Thai and curry is okay, I liked the yellow curry. But i would not order the Pad See Ew."
1124119,They have great pub food.  It is no wonder that they appeared on the Food Network when Guy Fieri came to town.  It's a fun place to visit!
1313294,"So I've been here a year ago and I gave it 5 stars. The food is still absolutely wonderful but the service is slow. I got there 30 min after they were opened so I don't think they were that busy. It took a very long time for me to get my drink order in and by the time I ordered my lemonade, it took a very long time for me to get it. My water glass was empty the whole time after I drank my first glass. I didn't have a good experience here. If I was only coming for the food, I would have gotten take out."
1657403,I was pretty disappointed with the sushi here. It had mostly already fallen apart by the time it got to my table. Over priced too. I left with most of my meal untouched.
1086186,"Hate to write bad reviews, but... started with luke warm chowder.  Grilled Salmon was seasoned nicely, too bad it was not cooked all the way through (a bit raw in the center) and again, my side of rice was luke warm as well.  I ordered the asparagus side and for $2.99 I got TWO, yes only two spears.  Staff was nice enough bringing this review up to two stars."
962331,"I'm a huge fan of Chipotle. Any location I go to so far. The food is great quality, healthier and fresh. The staff is always friendly and it is consistent. I've eaten at several across the US and I never get tired of it. 

I normally do the 3 tacos soft with a chips and guac. Refreshing and light."
812185,"This review is strictly for the benefit of the beer drinkers out there.

I visited with a wine-drinking friend.  There was one beer on tap.  The waiter described it as ""An IPA from California.""  After probing:  21st Amendment.  A pretty small list of beer by the bottle, mostly overpriced although decently chosen.

The food includes a lot of standard brewpub fare, although not nearly as good as at most brewpubs, and at wine bar prices.

Very ""Kirkland.""  If you live in Seattle and enjoy craft beer, you know what I mean."
1883869,"Speaks volumes when the restaurant owner takes the time to comment on most of the Yelp reviews, including mine. 

Good to know that they plan to be a mainstay anchor in the Belltown neighborhood. There can never be too many Italian restaurants! Go check it out - something for everyone."
2152697,Was here last night for happy hour with 5 other friends. Food was ok but worst of all there was fruit flies on our food. Manager came out to speak to us at my request and showed no sign of good service. Never replaced the order and all they did was take the item off our tab. After that we were never served again. Bad service will not be back and will notify health department on Monday
1501730,"Still just as delicioso as ever.

Funny anecdote to share: A couple weeks ago I was downtown visiting a friend for lunch with my box of Hello Robin cookies in hand. The middle-aged gentleman in the elevator sees my box and says ""Are those from Hello Robin?""

""Yes! Have you heard of it?""

""Actually, Robin's my neighbor!""

Small world."
812643,"Great place to come for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The service is friendly and there is a large amount of variety on the menu. 

Egg Florentine was delicious and they serve it with fresh made bread, 

Great sandwiches, club, turkey, pastrami, you can't go wrong. 

This place a a great bakery section and sweets section. You can find so many great things to eat and share with people. 

I would definitely come back and awesome for large groups."
891043,"First, I'm no sushi knowledge bucket, but I sure do like it and I've tried many well reviewed places.  Kisaku just keeps me coming back.  It has a nice, if simple, contemporary ambiance, with staff that quietly gives a nod of greeting and the quickest of smiles.  Fast but unrushed service and never a feeling of being the ""oroka na shiroi hito.""   The owner makes small talk but doesn't kill you with flattery and the sushi is always, always, ALWAYS wonderfully flavorful, textured, and artistic.  Dinner is as expensive as any other good Seattle restaurant --  but lunch is a screaming deal (well, sorta)."
851611,"The absolute BEST Indian food. What makes me happier is that my Indian friends (who came to the US for college) LOVE this place and will drive from Issaquah/Sammamish to eat here. 

The manager is a very sweet man, who takes great care of his customers' happiness. Our first time here, I was ordering take out and he gave me a cup of warm chai to apologize for the wait. it wasn't even a long or irregular wait time! So sweet.

And this is the BEST chai I've ever tasted. not too sweet, homemade, not powder mix.

This is the one restaurant that we go to together and find excuses to drive up to Northgate just for the food.

We've only had dinner here and we have quite the feast. For 2 people, we always order:
- Garlic naan - HUGE piece, very fluffy, perfectly seasoned and not burnt
- Butter chicken - does not taste like other butter chicken where all you can taste is butter; more like tikka masala to me but scrumptious. Our favorite sauce to soak up the rice and bread with
- Tandoori Tikka Masala chicken - delicious and perfectly cooked; always juicy! Comes with a green and pink sauce (cilantro and cranberry?) that is very good to dip the chicken in
- Chai - PERFECT!
- Mango Lassi - very mango flavored

Then we rotate another curry dish around - lamb vindaloo, keema, aloo gab, etc. 

We always have enough leftovers for 2 people to bring for lunch.

I tell everyone to go here when they crave Indian food. And having just returned from London (Veeraswarmy and Meli) this is STILL our favorite Indian spot!"
947026,Great food. Generous portions.
794717,Had my husband's birthday dinner here. The service was fantastic; Stephanie was wonderful and I would ask for her again. The meal was outstanding and the presentation was beautiful. What a splendid evening. The relish that came with the steak had such great flavor. The Halibut was amazing.
944776,"I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs up!  no really, this place is really good - a little suprising Ill admit, since at first glance it seems like just a novelty Texan-themed steakhouse with peanuts shells on the floor. Everything exceeded our expectations, however. Great service by our friendly waiter Peter!  Good happy hour drinks and apps, excellent crab cakes and crawfish chowder, my perfectly cooked, HUGE 14oz Filet, and awesome fully loaded potato! We definitley left stuffed and more than satisfied! We will return soon and frequently!"
1457199,"We have been up sick all night, we includes the dog.  We let the dog have a bite of the crust.  We did not heed the warnings from other reviews.  Seriously do not eat here.  We had a medium pizza with pepperoni and pineapple.  We drove all day and didn't want to venture out again for food.  Dugan's is across the street from the hotel and it seemed easy.  How bad could it be.  Well let me tell you -- it is real bad."
902768,"Asian fusion at its best!
It's worth going just to see and sit at the earthy natural edge tables and chairs."
1800023,"Los Agaves , is one the best places for Mexican food, you should tried ,the Tacos al pastor , or delicious Tamales or one huarache, are  flavorful and sabrosos,  authentic and fresh. I highly recommend them for your"
621628,"I don't mind falling head over heels for so called ""hipster"" vibe places if they have good food. That's all I ask for and I'll risk being labeled a hipster. This place missed that note. 

First of all, on a good note, the service was outstanding compared to the cold shoulders you'll usually find from other places in Seattle. Seated promptly, they explained how their happy hour works, and did it all with a genuine smile and a skip in his step. Letdown is that the coziness of the place was offset by those around you peeking over constantly to see what you got or just to look. I don't mind people looking over to see the plate but constantly looking even when new plates hasn't come out is just plain awkward. I had to stop the bf from ordering more just to get out of that squishy place. I like to have my own personal space with less staring. That's exactly what I got at Hot Cakes and their lovely chocolate decadence which made up for the tart I didn't let the bf order :)

We ordered a lobster bisque that was hot yet cold at the same time. Ate bits of ice that I thought was lobster pieces but wasn't.  The oysters were good but I wouldn't be able to tell because I'm just not an oyster expert. A good place to snack but not very filling if you go with guys."
880537,"Tap House Grill has an extensive beer list (160!!) including bottled beers and ones on tap. They have pre-selected 4 oz.flights of beer so you can try 4 domestic or international beers at one time, or you can make your own list of flights to sample. When I went my boyfriend got a burger that I tried and was totally mad at myself for not ordering. I got the dungeness crab mac and cheese which was alright, but nothing spectacular. Overall, I'd recommend this place for the beer and burgers!"
936831,"Dining at Altura is like being in Heaven. Each dish is a masterful combination of  exciting, delicious, and complex flavors. The beef carpaccio was creamy, smoky and tart. The  risotto with prosciutto and peas was as fine as the risotto at a Michelin starred  restaurant in Milan. The spiciness of the wild boar ragu was complimented by the sweetness of the parsnip gnocchi. The ribeye cap was the best beef I've ever had.
And I will never forget the texture of the luscious panna cotta -perfection!

The staff were all knowledgable, warm and attentive.  The setting was also warm and soothing in terms of lighting, sound, and decor. I highly recommend Altura and can't wait to go back myself!"
1650358,"Spring Garden is one of my favorite Asian restaurants (coming from a person that is picky when it comes to Asian food). I love their rice dishes here as well as their Thai tea. My family, on the other hand, loves their noodle dishes as well as their smoothies, especially the avocado smoothie! The food here is amazing and the service here is pretty good. The only negative thing I can think of is the location of the restaurant. It's in the corner near many Asian restaurants, making it difficult to find parking."
1921828,"I was a little disappointed. =( The staff was super duper friendly and awesome. But I felt my spam and eggs rice platter lacked flavor. Especially the garlic rice. It tasted really bland. The description sounded good but didn't taste much garlic and much seasoning on anything either. The rice was clumped together and sticky, almost mushy, not fluffy like I was expecting. The spam was delicious though, eggs cooked perfectly medium but that didnt have any seasoning as well. 

My husbands breakfast sandwich I forgot the name I remember it was a weird name, it had friend chicken in it, was good though, but I felt it needed more zest, and everything kind of tasted along the same flavor profile. I love having a sandwich where you can taste each layers specific category like ""Meat, sauce, pickles or something, cheese, bread"" but I felt everything tasted like fried, and lightly seasoned. Basically it just didnt WOW me like I was hoping it would. I would probably come back again and give this place a second shot, like trying that sausage platter or another crazy sandwich. 

Also I felt the prices are pretty high though, we paid $20 for two items and my rice platter was definitely not worth $10. Nor was the $10 sandwich. I've had AMAZING breakfast sandwiches for less the price of this one. Maybe if it included fries or a side dish with the sandwich I would give this place another star but I feel this place is over hyped. But like I said I will try something else from here again in the future if I ever come upon this truck. =)"
893900,"This is quickly becoming my favorite hangout when I visit Seattle. Very comfortable atmosphere, great view of the lake, nice outdoor deck, awesome food, friendly staff, fun holiday gimmicks... what's not to love?

I always order the mac & cheese jalapeno nuggets. If you haven't had them you are missing out on a great life experience."
822161,"Had a late breakfast here for the first time... The biscuits & gravy were amazing and for $9 came with 2 eggs and potatoes... Cute, friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere, with a bar in case a drink was needed... Will TOTALLY be back!"
1012452,"First time and just had two .99 each hard  shell tacos
The shells were light and freshly made.
Good flavor to the meat.
Came at none rush time. service was just a couple minutes and brought out to me on a tray with green and red freshly made hot sauces. Very good.
Will be coming back to try some of their plates dishes 

Rant: so I'll admit I've hit Taco bells from time to time ( come on we all have admit it)
So why in the world for the same price get a  good taco here that is bigger, an better in everyway over Taco Bell which basically next door? Not me ever again when in this area for Mexican"
934687,The BEST lamb souvlaki I've ever had!
818993,"I've only been here 3 times, but it has quickly become my favorite place. Although a bit on the pricey side for every day, it's a wonderful place to come for a date night or a special night out. The service is impeccible, the ambience warm and welcoming. The menu is not the most varied, but they have specials, which have been delicious, and some standbys that are incredible - like the truffle fries! We have been here with our 4 year old as well and it worked out well. They have a children's menu, but I wouldn't say it's the most child-friendly place, relatively speaking. Drinks are excellent too. I'm so happy we've moved within walking distance, a few blocks up the street! Dangerous...."
813101,Mmmmmm. Acres of clams!
866110,"It's overcrowded, understaffed.  I went in and there was no clear delineation as to where to stand.  I asked a waitress (Lydia) if I was in the way, she said yes with a smile but offered nothing to a solution.  The place is poorly designed.  I didn't eat here but I stood around waiting until someone said something, but nobody did.  Although people who came after me were served.  Lydia just kept walking back and forth.  Seriously, save your money.  If you look at the reviews, I am not by myself in this rating and experience.  I just name names.  Go to the Daily Grill (right up the street)."
1440761,"As a spicy food enthusiast, I must say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVEEEE THIS PLACE!

The spices were all very flavorful without being too overpowering. I've been to many other Szechuan places and this place has got to be the non-greasiest, clean-tasting Szechuan I've ever tried !!! (And what I mean by that is the food tastes amazing and I don't have to regret my spicy life decisions when I go to the toilet later) 

Their BOILED FISH dish was sooooo flavorful. I remember the fish being so nice and soft, it tasted almost like a spicy tofu soup! The broth was very flavorful and you can taste the chili peppers and peppercorn.

I also very much enjoyed the GARLIC BEEF. The sauce was sweet and tangy but not TOO sweet and not TOO tangy... it was perfect. You might have to watch out for bones though. 

Best thing about all these dishes? The sauces go well over their perfectly cooked rice. 

Enjoyed a nice korean black stout and sake with the meal so I had a very asian dinner. Seriously can't wait to go back!"
1894984,"Context: I've been to Italy so I'm a pizza snob. This thin crust pizza was delicious. I got the sausage and a friend got the mushroom and we shared. I really liked the sausage better since it had tomato sauce.

Beer selection was unique (great). We had a sour beer that went great. Beware that the beer prices were a bit high since they were speciality.

Service was great. We went at lunch and the pizzas came right out.

Place is cool but on the smaller side. I imagine this place will fill up once the word is out.

Definitely recommend this off the beaten path pizza joint."
2128311,"Haiku has a very large variety of Sushi as well as additional Japanese dishes.  I was impressed by the decor, the friendly staff and the food was very good.  I have been to other buffet style Sushi Restaraunts, but this was definitely by far a winner.  

I will absolutely be visiting them again when I am in the area!"
900632,"Consistently fast and tasty, but it's too loud. It's hard to get a better burger in the area at this price."
1121002,"their omelettes are great, with the cheesy cheese, smoked bacon and tomatoes....and the humongous hash brown underneath it with a cup of coffee. $15 is well worth it. 

Everyone in the Cafe are super friendly, especially Janelle. She keeps my coffee full at all time, my cup never went more than half empty. This place is a friendly cozy place you don't wanna leave."
43456,"The little lady had a hankering for some good clam chowder and a friend told us to try the dock area. We saw 3 different places and chose Chinooks.

First off, it must have been old folks day cuz I didn't see anyone under 55! it was about 2:30pm ish on a Wed and a little busier than we expected for 230.

I tried the clam chowder and also the shrimp/crab caesar salad. Both were good, but I think the salad was over priced at $18 for what you got. You can get just the shrimp caesar for I think about half if memory serves...shoulda went for that. The little lady had some mussel thing that I dont care for, but she said it was good and didn't have any complaints.

They do start you with some pretty good bread- very buttery.

Service was very good. Atmosphere was good. 

All in all, it was good - we would probably try one of the other places next door before we returned to Chinooks just to try something new, but we will probably come back at some point."
2124728,"I'm still a fan. A few things to note:
1) They don't have tofu available until a few hours AFTER they open, and they seem to run out of it and then that's IT for the day, lame, sad-face.
2) They will happily add extra veggies to your sandwich for no-charge, which takes it to the next level for me. Yay!

Yep, I'm still addicted and will just wait until after 1:00 to get my tofu sandwich fix...and I won't wait until 6:00 to try and get one either ;-)

UPDATE: The owner pm'd me to apologize and said that they had a problem with the fryer the day I couldn't get tofu in the morning, so apparently it was a fluke. Good follow-up by the owners!"
227342,"First visit and everything was dandy!

The Pad Thai was tasty and included little things such as green onion, peanuts, and a slice of lime.  I mention these since other places seem to be cutting corners."
804080,"I love Hi Spot! It's one of my favorite places to take a few friends visiting Seattle for breakfast, housed in a very cute multi-level spot that feels like home. Even when they are super busy (especially on the weekends, when you should expect a wait for outstanding food), the servers and staff always make sure you're satisfied. I am dairy-free, and found that substituting guacamole for the cheese and cream in their delicious breakfast burrito is one of the best choices I've ever made. Their Mickey buttermilk pancakes are also super cute, three cakes shaped  together like the iconic mouse head and presented with fruit toppings for the eyes and mouth. I sadly couldn't eat them, but my dining companion said they were the best pancakes he has had in a long time. That's eating good in the neighborhood."
241358,"The owner is a very friendly. Food tastes good, the price is fair.. I never been here for dinner but for lunch it seemed a great place to have bite and a good conversation. The place decorated carefully and successfully makes you feel you are in Bangkok. You must try."
88921,"Stopped in here because they were a late-night place. When you walk in you get hit with the size and eclectic design of the place. Candles all over the wall. The menu says they were chosen to be in the Top 10 best Happy Hour food places in the country. Cajun menu with other items as well. HUGE menu -- all really good, although some of the items may be too 'out-there' for some.
Not a touristy place at all. Easy to drive right by. Mostly locals and University folks.
Highly recommended."
1309399,"Ate at the Ranch Drive In for the first time yesterday.  I went there with high expectations as the person I met there has lived in the area since he was born and he could not stop raving about this establishment. 
After paying over $12 for a Ranch burger with cheese and bacon, onion rings, and. Medium drink I was taken aback by the price!!! We could have gone to another burger place up the road and paid less!!
When the burger arrived, I was not impressed by the flat piece of meat that came with the burger. Just from a visual standpoint that was disappointing to say the least. I counted the onion rings - 12!!
When I bit into the burger it did have a flavor, however it was totally dry.!! A good burger should be dripping from the juices that come out of the meat when you bite into it. This was not the case. I used 2 napkins the entire meal!!  The onion rings were tasty, however, I have had better. The friendly staff could not over compensate for the meal I just had. Will I eat there again?  Maybe not, as there are so many other good hamburger joints in the area!"
1334005,"What Cedar's lacks in swank, it more than make up for in flavor! Every time my man suggests it, I hesitate because I'm usually hoping for something with a bit more ambience. However, I am ALWAYS do glad we end up there! The food is truly authentic and delicious! #naanfordays!"
1326250,"The weekend brunch at Stumbling Goat is excellent. I love the eggs benedict and we can't come without ordering the brioche french toast. Don't miss the house made sausage. They're great about using local organic ingredients, even though the prices are reasonable. This place is a gem."
513060,Great atmosphere. You should go during happy hour because the food is great and a lot cheaper. The Mac and cheese was really great!
1348908,Great little place. Don't be turned away by the general store look. They have great food and equally as great service. I will be back!
2620247,"I went here with a group of 13 people 4th July weekend for lunch for their happy hour. They were accommodating for such a big group and gave us great service.

The food was fantastic and was priced so cheap I couldn't believe it. I would have been more than happy to pay double the cost because it was honestly one of the best sushi meals I have ever had. Next time I'm in Seattle I am definitely going to go back."
976912,"Corned beef hash extraordinary. East coast sandwich had just the right amount of zing. All six of us loved the food, though a bit slow. Personable service."
1961136,"I'm just going to go straight at this...

The Good Stuff
-Clean
-Easy to read menu
-Food was pretty good

The Bad Stuff
- We were rushed into ordering.  We were looking for somehting to order, but the waitress just stood there without saying anything.  We asked for a minute, but she would literally come back in a minute.
- We were given tea when we got there.  Did not get a chance to ask for refill after our orders were served.
- Asked for two waters, but was only given one.  Asked again, and she got side tracked even though there was only one other customer there.
-Rushed out.  Got the check in the middle of the meal, and was asked to pay... before we were done.  (no, it wasnt closing time)

Overall this was just a horrible/awkward experience.  We were patient, respectful and very courtious.  Still was treated poorly when we were the customers.  This place gets only one star since I liked the food."
833254,"We should haven known something was up by the mere fact that it was half, if not less, empty. And stayed that way. We were one of like 4 couples all night. 

We bought the living social deal for the 3-course meal and a bottle of house wine. If not for the nice atmosphere and the live jazz music it would have been terrible. But it wasn't far. 

The service was horrible. I dont need a server who over plays it, i was a server and I dont need someone to treat me like I'm at Disneyland. But smile, at least once? or just try not to act like you hate your job that much. 

The food was incredibly overpriced, undercooked, and small in portion size. We got the tiniest salads in the world, i'm talking like 5 bites of watery lettuce with a little bit of dressing and 3 croutons. 

The fish and chips were like 3 tiny pieces of fish and half of the fries were burnt. 

The salmon was fine, but I asked for grilled prawns and I got fried and coconut covered prawns, and they made us pay like $7 bucks extra. FOR THREE OF THEM. 3 tiny WRONGLY cooked shrimp is almost ten bucks? get the fuck out of here. 

We didn't even bother with desert since nothing else had been good, even though the desert came with the living social deal. When we got the bill, it was $89!! Of course, we just had to pay for the tax and prawns (wtf? Why would your 3 course meal living social deal not cover the tax??) and we left. 

NEVER going back. It wasn't even an easy spot to get to, and it has no view of the water or anything. I read a few reviews that people just eat the happy hour or go for trivia. Maybe that's better, when you're there for reasonable prices only eating cheap shitty bar happy hour food and beer. But save your $100 for a dinner elsewhere!!"
790682,"Love what they do and what they cook. Though I am usually here for volunteering, the restaurant has a program that invite people off the streets and into the culinary field. Most of their employees or interns wind up opening their own restaurants or working for incredibly renown restaurants. The chefs are completely professional and attentive on the floor and in the kitchen. 

Farestart does great wonders in providing for homeless shelters, supermarkets, and schools. They accomplish so much and make a name for themselves. 
Did you know they had Top Chef aired there last year? Phenomenal!"
1371259,"Fairly overpriced for a burger and soggy fries. The options galore were certainly appreciated, but really all I wanted was a standard cheeseburger which ended up running me near 7 dollars. I get the whole gourmet burger idea, but really I think I 'll pass the next time I have a hankering"
854511,The one thing you must get are the doughnuts!!!!  Good service and the rest the food was pretty good.
1933752,"The food is fine, but they give you way smaller portions than other chipotle's."
894647,"Always a favorite place to eat!  The service is great, sometimes it gets too busy but if you want a hot good meal it is worth the wait.  Blueberry pancakes are the best!"
1660283,"This is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. Everything is delicious- the brisket tacos are scrumptious and the salsas are super tasty. The service is spot on. It's great for lunch, dinner, or a late night snack."
848372,Dirty staff... I saw someone wipe their nose and didn't bother washing their hands.  The food is 'meh'... They could do so much more with this place.
1298196,"It's cheap, it's fast and for restaurant pho it is good. As a baseline, I always resort to Than Brothers if I am unsure of other pho place. No one beats my moms but if I need a quick, large, cheap bowl; Than Brothers is the place to go. 

Now if they could only get a liquor license at all their locations..."
1866445,"I went here last night and the service was HORRIBLE the food was just ok. This is the 2nd time I have eaten here and both times the services was slow and the food was nothing to write home about. 
First it took 30 min just to get our drinks and almost an hr for our appetizer. I would somewhat understand this service if it was busy but there where maybe 3 other couples in the whole place. When we finally got our appetizer they warned us it was really hit so to be careful. Well they lied it was hardly warm and the cheese was not fully melted inside. I am so thankful I got the groupon because if I would have paid full price I would have been very upset. I feel bad for only leaving a 3 dollar tip because normally I tip at least 25% but the service really was that bad. I will never go again. If was not for the movies this place would never make it."
862189,"Went for mother day dinner, chef not overly entertaining . Food came fast and furious. Felt rushed for dinner. Nothing special, food adequate but over priced for what you get. This establishment is not a place for frequent diners but for the special once in a blue moon entertainment spot. Service slow and not very attentive considering the amount of staff there. Gotta step up the game if they want regulars .  Better food elsewhere at a better price. So many employees you'd think service would be impeccable . A few faults ... Try this place if you've never been...."
1954191,"Very disappointing and completely average. Based on the reviews, I chose this place for a well-priced, special Italian meal. Well-priced it was, but far from special. I think we were in and out of here in about 40 minutes, which would appeal to some but not what I was looking for."
2131540,"I love their #2 the Cuban roast pork sandwich. Whenever i go around that area, i always so this place to fill my stomach. It's juicy and tender. Even good when it gets cold. Always long line-up. But it worth waiting !! I wish they more restaurants somewhere in North."
916631,"Current having 50 yr special with beer and burgers. 
The burgers are overcooked and the drinks are just ok.
I'm guessing due to the specials that's the reason why there are people waiting out the door for the place. Otherwise the food and drinks arent that spectacular or worth writing home about."
1951465,"Salumi's porchetta sandwich is one of the most amazing things I've ever put in my mouth. Moist, fatty, succulent pork sandwiched between thick slices of bread with a spread of some kind of herb-y garlicky paste is exactly the kind of thing that you would hop on a flight and fly across the coast for. 

Like all amazingly orgasmic food, they tend to run out and the lunch line gets rather long, so arrive early and know exactly what you want beforehand. I would jump through hoops of fire for this sandwich, so arranging an earlier lunch doesn't sound so difficult.
If the unfortunate fate of sold out porchetta has happened upon you (my dear child, my utmost condolences) then almost everything is amazingly fantastic here--including the meatball sandwich and the cold cut sandwiches. 

Bought a pack of Mole salami with my sandwich to snack on later, and it did not last a hour. Dark, salty and with a hint of cocoa, the mole blew my mind. I couldn't imagine any of their sausages tasting better, but something tells me I am wrong about that!
Salumi is easily one of my favorite destinations of Seattle, and an absolute must for all pork lovers."
1339175,"Roux offers a menu filled with unique ingredients that have been butchered by culinary shortcuts that would make hand-rolled cow shit taste good.  

Between the four of us, we tried the Frog Legs, Tete de Cochon (a fancy pants way of saying a pig's face), Jambalaya, Gnocchi with Black Truffle, Spicy Turtle and Pork Bolognese, and the Fried Rabbit Saddle.  It all sounds like the sparkly and innovative brain-child who is breaking new grounds for the Seattle restaurant scene. 

Everything, except for the Tete de Cochon and Jambalaya, tasted pretty average considering what could have happened with said ingredients.  Those at my table who ordered the Gnocchi and Fried Rabbit Saddle were less than satisfied with their dishes.  The look on their faces after they took a bite of their food was like they had some iron-clad fist that was freshly cut and dried shoved up their butts.

I applaud them for dealing with unusual ingredients that are apparently sourced domestically.  The flavors are all there; however, when you dress such ingredients with deep-fry batter or a spicy sauce, it ruins the integrity and flavor.  

I ordered the Turtle and Pork Bolognese and couldn't tell the turtle and pork apart as far as flavor or texture.  It was pretty much a scrambled, indistinguishable novelty hidden in a spicy bolognese.  The dish was filling, properly seasoned, and a solid pasta dish, but I expected a little more turtle, just turtley enough to be in the turtle club.

I highly recommend the Tete De Cochon, it's pork cheek with an egg on top that trembles and falls apart so delicately inside of your mouth.  You may start foaming at the corners of your mouth.  Just let it happen.  

Also, they don't have a central heating system here.  There weren't enough layers of clothing to conceal our hardened nipples.  Not having a central heating system is like a woman, like myself, who has a cavernous purse that eats everything and can't get anything right.  Get your shit together."
1760138,"Authentic Japanese ramen with plenty of additions to choose from. I normally get the takoyaki since it's one of the only places nearby that makes it. Very good, always friendly. I've ordered takeout and it's normally done before I even get there."
1667670,"The food has gone down over the years but I keep coming back, its still an icon with a great view. Enjoy a drink with friends and loved one and a bowl of chowder."
1339744,"Oh Ikea your cheap furnishings and cool artwork keep me coming back for more.

Once you enter the store by the time you leave a few days might have went by!

It's a great store well laid out to see examples of their furniture in use. But the store is literally a maze with shortcuts although I don't think there is an easy way through. I would give yourself at least 3-4 hours to make it out of there.

Now with their Ikea family card you get free coffee in their cafeteria halfway through the store!"
1337041,"The food was tasty and the service was great.  i had the biscuits and gravy and my dining companion had the classic breakfast with fried chicken.  The biscuit comes with bacon chunks in it...HELLO!  It's gotta be good.

There were a few small problems.  My eggs arrived over cooked.  One was very overcooked.  I asked for another and they brought me two more which was thoughtful but a little wasteful.  

Also, they have a huge beer and cocktail selection.  But don't be too adventurous or you may find yourself paying for a beverage that you didn't drink. I don't know, and yes, I've said it before, but when you sit for a few hours, enjoying brunch and multiple drinks, spending over $100, it seems like they'd take the beer that was sent back off of the bill.  Maybe that's just me.

Overall, the Burgundian was a fine experience."
205791,"the food here is solid, service is good, and the atmosphere is lovely for a date. i've had dishes be inconsistent, but overall love this cute little neighborhood bistro. nice bartender."
1900027,"Slowest service I have ever experienced, and now waiting on food and drinks to see it it was worth the painfully long wait. The vermicelli and pho were great. Had the rare beef pho and enjoyed the broth immensely. The grilled pork vermicelli was yummy. Drink list was extensive, but cocktails not really their forte."
998808,"I chose to come to this restaurant this year for my 18th birthday.  I like to go to nice vegetarian restaurants, and this is one that I haven't been to before.

We all ordered quite a few appetizers, including the mediterranean plate, which was awesome.  The hummus was delicious, and so were all of the vegetables included with it.  The pita was wonderfully delicious, and so was the baba ganoush.  Every other appetizer I tried was amazing as well.

The entrees however, were not in line with the quality of the appetizers.  The bean burger I ordered was a bit too mushy, and a little bland.  Everyone else at my table was not too impressed with their entree either.  It was okay, but a bit of a let down after the appetizers.

The dessert turned around the meal though.  The vegan cheese cake was the best one that I have ever had, and the bread pudding was great as well.  I normally don't like bread pudding much, but this one was amazing.

The next time I go here, I plan on skipping the entrees and just eating the appetizers.  If they were to up the quality of their entrees, my review would most definitely be 5 stars."
